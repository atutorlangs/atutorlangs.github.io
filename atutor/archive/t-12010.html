				<p>Thanks, I  found those folders, but I noticed that ownership is set that only user can read, write and execute.  When I tried to use command chmod and to add ownership for others, I could not do that.<br />
<br />
Since that folder is created by ATutor itself how can I change ownership of that folder?<br />

Thanks,<br />

				<p>You'd need to be the root user to change permissions. <br />
<br />
Normally the content directory should only be writable by the webserver, otherwise you'd be opening the directory for security breaches.</p>

				<p>I understand what you say, but it seems to me that it is out of teh user's control to know how Atutor named the folder and what will be written in URL for respective image that should be inserted in teh course.  Respectively, I think that users i.e. instructors should have full control on managing content and names of folders that are subfolders of /content folder.<br />
If there are a lot of courses it is hard to find out which number is associated to certain instructor's course.<br />
<br />
I have situation that file is uploaded, instructor does not know which number is associated to his/her course and it is hard to gues what is URL to the image.<br />
One of solutions is that admin use FTP and upload files in /content/images and such a URL is written as link to the image.  But, such a procedure is I suppose not default in ATutor.<br />
please advise.<br />

Best wishes,<br />

				<p>Actually, the instructor normally never needs to know what is the ID for his/her course.<br />
<br />
If you're familiar with HTML, then when addressing a file in the file manager, you can think of the "&lt;base href=... />" tag as being set to the file manager's root directory withing the course you're in.<br />
<br />
In other words, if you have an image uploaded to "lesson_1" folder in the file manager, you could just write:<br />
<br />
[b]&lt;img src="lesson_1/image_01.gif" />[/b]<br />
<br />
<br />
Moreover, putting the full address into the file path is strongly discouraged:<br />
First, you'll get things broken once having moved to other hosting, copied the course, or just restored from a backup.<br />
Second, it is recommended for security reasons that the content directory is moved outside the directories handled by the web server. It has been mentioned several times, e.g. http://help.atutor.ca/admin/new_installation.php?en .</p>
