				<p>Hello!<br />
<br />
I have read the thread "common resources" and have a similar question. Because we have four courses on the same subject (only different levels) I would like to have one forum for all the students of this category. Is it possible to do this or should I post to the feature request?<br />
<br />
Is it possible to have a public forum for an otherwise private course?<br />
<br />
Question: how could I remove the word "Uncategorized" in the "Browse Courses"? (And still have some uncategorized courses). Also, is it possible that the number in the brackets after the name fo the parent category does not say (0) if all the courses are in the subcategories (for example it could say the total numer of courses in the categories). Or at least to remove the "Uncategorized" completely?<br />
<br />
I have also one funny thing to report: on my computer the link above "Create and edit this course's banner text and style" in the Tools section does not exists. On all the other computers in the house it works? It is not really essential because I can change it from somewhere else, but still I wanted to share with you this particularity. <br />
<br />
As you can see I am not a programmer, but if it is needed I could ask someone to help me (if I know what is to be done).<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your kind help.<br />
<br />
Regards, Ganga</p>

				<p>All of the above is possible with some code editing. Some of it you could probably do by finding your way to the code and commenting it out. Look through the sourrounding code to see how its do. <br />
<br />
Some of the functionality you've described would be fairly unique to your situation, so it might not make it into a distribution. You could post your feature requests to the Feature Requests forum, and see if they're of interest to others.<br />
<br />
Re the funny tool page behaviour, there' nothing in the page's markup that would cause the problem you've describe. It was probably a browser glitch.</p>
