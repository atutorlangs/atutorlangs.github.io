				<p>hi,<br />
i am experiencing a bit weird behavior of my atutor server. one of the instructors has created a course of about 12MB(zipped). as the size of the course grows, working(even browsing) with it becomes impossible. but only with this "huge" course, working with others is fine. ATutor version is 1.4.1. I've been trying installing a separate instance of ATutor(version 1.4) and importing the course into it, but with no success.<br />
i'm running:<br />
Linux gentoo 2.6.7-gentoo-r8<br />
Apache/2.0.50 (Gentoo/Linux) mod_ssl/2.0.50 OpenSSL/0.9.7d PHP/4.3.8<br />
MySQL 4.0.20<br />
Pentium III (Coppermine)@930.40<br />
256MB RAM<br />
phpinfo: http://gentoo.jsw.sk/info.php<br />
<br />
thanks a lot</p>

Could potentially be mod_ssl that's slowing down atutor if it has to process very large files. The overall size of the course should not matter. We also recommend using Apache 1.3* instead of 2.0</p>

<br />
Could it be even if the server does not use https for any of the applications that run on it?<br />

So think I, but browsing and editing courses that are not so large makes no problem. Problem exists only when working with large courses.</p>

				<p>Hi,<br />
I've installed an apache version 1.3.31 with no SSL support but problem persists. I have no idea what to do, working with large courses is nearly impossible even on the same host.</p>

				<p>We seem to have duplicated the problem. We noticed the Play Here Course demo (a very large course) getting slower over time and suspect its a result of having to retrieve the content to construct the menu displays etc. <br />
<br />
We do have plans to update the ContentManager class in an upcoming release, which should releave the problem somewhat. We'd also like to extend the caching capabilities of ATutor to cache course content. Currently the interface language is cached.</p>
