				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm currently looking to use atutor as my LMS for a course I'm offering, but I'm concerned about whether or not I'll be able to set up navigations through my website the way I'd like.<br />
<br />
The atutor index.php leads straight into a login/registration page, but I'm interested in having a homepage that explains myself, the classes and the organization before jumping straight into the atutor interface, requiring a login and/or registration before being able to provide the user with any information.<br />
<br />
Does atutor provide solutions fo rthis?   Or can the atutor directory simple be moved into a sub-directory and then linked to from the new index page?  I've seen a couple websites that go so far as to use multiple domains (xxxxx.com for the homepage, xxxxx.net for the atutor page), and would prefer not to have to register two domains if I could avoid it.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Yates</p>

				<p>Usually in a case like you describe, you put ATutor in a sub-directory, and link to it from another page on a site.<br />
<br />
There are a number of CMS to ATutor integration modules you might look into if you want something for managing non-learning related content. Or just simply create a separate page outside ATutor as the gateway into it.</p>

				<p>That was my first thought, but this is a site that will be used and updated by multiple instructors, most of whom do not posses the same kind of technical/programming prowess I have.<br />
<br />
The better question is, is there a module for a welcome page with integrated text, formatting, etc...<br />
<br />
Thank you for the reply.</p>

				<p>Maybe I'm misunderstanding. <br />
<br />
You're offering one course. Have multiple instructors for that course, each who would need to be able to edit the welcome page? <br />
<br />
There isn't such a page, or module, but if it were a page only the administrator of ATutor might alter, the Browse and About pages can be edited and used as welcome pages.  If you look at the atutor.ca demo site, the login screen there acts as a "welcome" page a separate ATutor installation elsewhere. There are lots of other ways you could do what you've described. <br />
<br />
It probably would not take much to build a module to give you what you need if you want to explore that possibility. See the module developer documentation for details.</p>
