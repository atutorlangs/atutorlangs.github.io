All my students complain about being unable to submit their quizes, except those using MACs. Is this a security issue with windows? I tried it on a windows computer too and was unable to submit a quiz. I did not have that problem with it last year.</p>

What version(s) of IE is the problem occuring with?<br />
<br />
Just to confirm, what is the ATutor version number. See the admin's home page. Also post the other system specs, php version in particular. Perhaps it has been been updated and introduced the problem.</p>

				<p>I am able to reproduce the problem, but only on Windows 7 with IE 9. Test submission seem to work okay on all other browsers and OSs. We'll make a note of this in the bug tracker, and try to deal with it in the next dev cycle (starting in a week or two).<br />
<br />
For now I'd suggest telling students there is a problem with IE9 when submitting tests, and to use any other browser when taking tests.<br />

Thanks Greg,<br />

Glad I was able to find something for once that wasn't a red herring. <br />
