				<p>Hello<br />
<br />
http://articulate.com<br />
<br />
I've been searching for some information on this subject but I cannot find very much.<br />
<br />
These software packages look fantastic and could open a lot of doors for our Online Training courses within Atutor. However, we don't want to invest $1000 on something that will not be compatible.<br />
<br />
Articulate's site say they are compatible with LMS's and SCORM but I'm a little unsure on what the latter is and if Atutor falls into that category.<br />
<br />
Has anyone here had any experience with using Articulate and Atutor together? What are our options?<br />
<br />
Any help on the situation would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Rury</p>

				<p>I can't say for certain that Articluate content will work with ATutor. Product conformance with the standards are not equal.<br />
<br />
I might suggest you try a demo of articulate and upload a package to our demo site, or to a test course on your own installation of ATutor.<br />
<br />
Be sure not to confuse content packages with sharable content objects (SCOs), the latter of which needs to be imported into the ATutor SCORM Packages module.<br />
<br />
You might try the Reload editor. Its free.</p>

				<p>Hey Greg<br />
<br />
I'll try out the free trial and see how that works out.<br />
<br />
Is Atutor compliant with SCORM 1.4/2004 or AICC standards? If so then Articulate should play nice with Atutor.<br />
<br />
Thank you for suggesting Reload editor as I was looking for alternatives, I'll check it out.</p>

				<p>Only SCORM 1.2 in the current module. There is a SCORM 2004 RTE coming from the community, though it may be a little while before its available.</p>
