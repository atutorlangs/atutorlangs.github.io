				<p>If you are asking for help, provide lots of detail so problems can be reproduced.<br />
<br />
Things to describe: <br />
  operating system - NT<br />
  version of ATutor - 1.5.1<br />
  versions of php - 4.3<br />
  version of mysq l - 4.0.23<br />
  webserver & version - Windows IIS/6.0<br />
  copies of error messages - n/a<br />
  changes to default settings - n/a<br />
  web browser being used - IE/Firefox<br />
  and anything else relevant - no<br />
<br />
I did a fresh install... it was a perfect installation process... (KUDOS to Atutor experts for a clean installation program)... <br />
<br />
After the install, I went to my login page and I put my user-name and password in to do my log-in.. now I tried both on my teacher's account and my admin account.. .gernerally what is supposed to happen is that it re-directs you to the appropriate index.php page... but in my case it did not do that... it gave a message at the top that was highlighted in green that said that I was successfully logged in.<br />
<br />
There has to be something that I have forgotten or have not done, but I cannot figure it out.  Does anyone know why I would not be re-directed to the appropriate page after I log in... but stay at the log-in page... its kinda weird..  Any help would be appreciated!  :) <br />
