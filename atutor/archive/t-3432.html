				<p>I truly appreciate the time y'all take to help newbies to ATuror, such as myself.<br />
<br />
I have searched through the forums and through my files and have not found the answer to my questions. (Hopefully I did not somehow miss this!)<br />
<br />
When a member receives confirmation that they have been accepted by the instructor for a course, the email they receive says, "Root User" in the from field. Could you tell me if it is possible to change this to a name my users would recognize? And if so, where I would do this?<br />
<br />
I also noticed that the system gives you an option to use the "send to" option for email contacts on the site. Could you please advise me as to which option is considered more secure? (Sorry my tech skills are limited :( )<br />
<br />
Thany you again, for any input you are able to provide. I am using 1.4.2<br />

Not sure what you're talking about re "send to", or what you are referring to in "...which option is considered more secure"</p>
