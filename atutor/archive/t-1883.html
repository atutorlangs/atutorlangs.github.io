				<p>Thanks for the infomration Greg. I don't suppose you have any idea when this will be? I have had to come up with a quick fix and that was to dp all the listening tests in Hot Potatoes but the teachers are not happy as there is no way they can see the grades unless they look as soon as the students have finished.<br />
<br />
I did consider doing them in Moodle but I thought better of it.<br />

Cheers<br />

				<p>Thanks Greg. It would have been a major task to redo all the listening tests. We have 45 groups of 30 students in two courses - that is about 100 hours of course material and thanks to ATutor and ACollab it makes the teachers life much easier. Some teachers are now beginning to create their own supplementary material for courses and this is due to the fact that they find ATutor relatively easy to use.<br />
