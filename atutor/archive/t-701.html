				<p>Hello,<br />
I just installed ATutor for testing the LCMS.<br />
Everything worked.<br />
I can export and (very important!!!) IMPORT an IMS-Package into ATutor.<br />
<br />
Most of my Materials are JPG-Slides.<br />
But they are not displayed when clicking them.<br />
Does ATutor only display HTML and graphics inside HTML???<br />
I thought ATutor would import the whole IMS-structure including JPG, Sounds etc. and could perform like the viewer in the LRN Toolkit from Microsoft or the very good "Reload Editor"...<br />
Any ideas??<br />

You can not compare ATutor packaging with LRN or Reload, niether of which will run off the web.</p>

<br />
Sure, but the content of the package can be displayed within a browser too (LRN-Viewer, SCORM-Viewer etc.):<br />
I thought, that atutor realizes: a resource with the extension jpg or gif must be a picture...ok, lets display it.<br />

The Viewer is intended for viewing ATutor content, though it will view properly formatted HTML from other systems.</p>

How long would it take to integrate these content types and is it feasible in the near future? It really doesn't sound too difficult but with out knowing core of the system, i couldn't really say.<br />

We may be interested in helping to fund this kind of development, but we are still assessing if ATutor is the right solution for our organization.<br />

				<p>I think "travis" is right!<br />
<br />
It can't be a problem to display standards like gif, jpg, jpeg within HTML.<br />
<br />
For sounds (wav, mp3, ogg ...) and video (avi, rm, wmv...) and all other content like ppt, doc, pdf ...you just let the users machine do the job which means: The machine decides via extension which application has to start for displaying the content.<br />
This is exact the behavior of the LRN Viewer from MS or the Reload Editor.<br />
<br />
Alternately a simple "save as" on the local machine could help much.<br />
<br />
I really like the idea of this open source LCMS, and I think the implementation should not be a problem for the programmers.</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>There is currently no problem embedding flash, images, or any other media in ATutor content. There are many examples in the ATutor demos. <br />
<br />
We are considering adding a utility to the content packaging tools that will create HTML around non-web content so it can be downloaded using a hyperlink, or perhaps an embedded player if a user has a plugin installed. This is a fairly easy fix. In the meantime, upload your files with the filemanager and create links to those files within ATutor content.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that LRN and Reload are not web applications. Content displayed in ATutor must be formatted in HTML since it runs in a Web browser. <br />
<br />
If you can show us an example of a Web application that displays non-Web formats we may be able to gather ideas from what others have done.</p>

				<p>Travis, if there is funding, we can create just about anything. If you want to draft a specification for how you think ATutor should handle non-Web formats, we'll consider it.<br />

[quote]Just HTML formatted content  [/quote] .<br />
As long as it is possible to add the images it should work for now, down the road i would assume that having packages import with the links intact would be a helpful feature for less technical users.</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>If you have properly formatted HTML around your media objects, ATutor does maintain the links when importing and exporting content packages. An HTML authoring tool is also being considered for ATutor, though that may be a version or two away.<br />
<br />
See the Flash demo in the Play Here Course as the "demo" user (and the section on Object Embedding in HowTo). Use the content editor to view the HTML used to embedded the Flash (or images if you want to look at the other examples). Export the Flash demo as a content package, then try importing it, or try viewing it in its own (rudimentary) viewer, or in LRN or Reload.<br />
<br />
When you create your Flash content, use the Flash authoring tool to generate the approriate HTML, then paste that HTML into an ATutor content page. Upload the Flash with the filemanager, then adjust the path in the HTML to point to the file in your course content directory.<br />
