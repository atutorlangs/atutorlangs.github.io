			<div class="body">
				<p>I have created a long html for the content. When I upload a long html content from a new course it is saved on column "text" on AT_content. I can check (by doing a select text from AT_conten where content_id=...) that my uploaded html has truncated some final part of the &lt;body> tag! It seems that ATutor removes the &lt;head>..&lt;/head> tags and preserves the text inside the &lt;body>..&lt;/body> tag but it seems that it has eaten the tail if it (about 200 lines of the &lt;body>, in fact). What can be the problem?<br />
<br />
My system:<br />
<br />
Debian Sarge Linux 3.1.<br />
mysql  Ver 12.22 Distrib 4.0.16, for pc-linux (i686)<br />
Apache/2.0.55 (Debian) mod_python/3.1.3 Python/2.3.5 PHP/4.4.2-1 mod_perl/2.0.2 Perl/v5.8.<br />
<br />
I have root user access to the remote server with the ATutor installed. <br />
<br />
Php-info url: http://148.204.74.44/ATutor/phpinfo.php<br />
<br />
The source page at: http://148.204.74.44/ATutor/source.html<br />
The converted page, as found on AT_content.text: http://148.204.74.44/ATutor/dest.html<br />
<br />
I do not include the converted page as it is show on the course but I think it is enoug to put the dump of AT_content.text. <br />
<br />
But you can see it in the course:<br />
http://148.204.74.44/ATutor/browse.php?cat=0&show_course=107#info<br />
And the content is: <br />
http://148.204.74.44/ATutor/content.php?cid=279<br />
<br />
If you see strange characters you can use UTF-8 as the encoding. I have not included it on the htmls to show these exactly as they were played.<br />
<br />
I hope you can guide me on a right way to solve this problem. If more information is needed i'll be happy to provide it.</p>

				<p>In 1.5.2 only the content between the BODY elements is imported<br />
<br />
The HTML of the document you imported is not valid HTML. I'm guessing it was imported from a MSWord document. Word makes a great mess of HTML. Try searching google for "clean word html", you should come up with a bunch of tools that can be used to clean up your converted word documents.</p>

				<p>Thanks! as you said, the problem was the word converter to html. I've found a free tool to do the job of clean the html code: if someone else needs it, it is in http://office.microsoft.com/Downloads/2000/Msohtmf2.aspx</p>
