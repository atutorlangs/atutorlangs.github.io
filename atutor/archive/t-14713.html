				<p>I just installed ATutor and I'm already frustrated that I cannot access the super-admin account. I've been able to create a new account, which I can use to log in, but I cannot access the super-admin account to manage courses or users. ATutor won't recognize the username or email address I setup, despite the fact that I looked at the database and verified that the username and email are correct. How do I access the super-admin account, clear the existing super-admin account, or create a new super-admin account?<br />
<br />
My details:<br />
operating system  - Linux<br />
version of ATutor - 1.6.1<br />
versions of php - 4<br />
version of mysql - 4.1<br />
webserver & version - Apache</p>

				<p>I seem to have figured out this problem, but I've discovered a new problem in the process. As for the password problem, there appears to have been an error during the creation of the account. I created a username and password, but ATutor doesn't seem to have saved the password. I was able to access the super-admin account when I typed the username without a password. <br />
<br />
My new problem involves a MySQL error that prevents me from creating a new administrator account. The error reads:<br />
<br />
"You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'privileges, last_login) VALUES ('administrator',' at line 7".<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how to solve this new problem. Any suggestions would be welcome.</p>
