				<p>I just updated to the latest version (1.5.4), and initially had a problem with a $_stacks argument on line 208 in /includes/header.inc.php which the error message said was not an array. I went to the code and changed it to [php](array)$_stacks[/php] and that made the error message go away. <br />
<br />
However, I still have no side menu in my courses. I can advance through course content with the arrow icon, but cannot see the outline of the course, nor any modules on the right side. (Frankly, I wish I knew how to move the menu to the left side, but that's another issue.)<br />
<br />
In addition, when I login using my former admin username, I have access only to basic system preferences, error logging and cron-setup...nothing else, including no courses. Is there a default admin login for new installs that I should be using. <br />
<br />
I'm glad that I don't seem to have lost my content, but I have lost most functionality. What can I tell you that would help you puzzle this out?<br />

				<p>and "content navigation" is turned on in the side menu I guess? <br />
<br />
regarding moving the menu: I'm working on a new theme where this is resolved, and the menu can be moved left / right by altering a few lines in the CSS.</p>

				<p>My first though is to restore the original version from the database backup and the copy of the ATutor directories you made before upgrading, then try upgrading again.<br />

Please describe the system ATutor is running on if you need more help.</p>

				<p>I do have the old directories, but I do not have a db backup.<br />
Which folders should I overwrite with the old ones?<br />
<br />
Here's some more on my setup...Apache/1.3.33 (Darwin) PHP/4.4.0 DAV/1.0.3 mod_ssl/2.8.24 OpenSSL/0.9.7l<br />
<br />
Vegard: I don't know where to turn on content navigation, since I have almost nothing in the admin panel when I login with my old admin username.</p>

				<p>Without a backup of the database, you'll need to do a manual install, which is essentially setting up ATutor without running the db upgrade scripts (in fact do not run the installer/upgrade this time).<br />
<br />
Move you broken upgrade directory to a new location, or rename it. <br />
<br />
Unpack a fresh copy of ATutor 1.5.4 into the old location  of the  broken upgrade.<br />
<br />
Copy or move the include/config.inc.php file and the content directory from the broken upgrade into the fresh copy.<br />
<br />
That should be anoutgh to get you running. Depending on customiztions, modules, etc, there may be a few more steps to copy eveything over from the broken upgrade.<br />
<br />
We do have a troubleshooting/installation service available if you'd like us to repair things for you. See the services page:<br />
http://www.atutor.ca/services/index.php<br />
<br />
Turn on content navigation as the instructor under the Manage tab, then Student Tools>Side menu</p>
