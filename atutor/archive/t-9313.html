				<p>I am currently using the most updated versions of ATutor, MySQL, PHP. I would like to use ATutor to conduct some studies with human subjects in which user privacy needs to be protected. Please tell me more about security in ATutor. Does the platform support https? How to protect user's data?<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>ATutor works fine under https. <br />
<br />
There were no reported security flaws in the current version in the security checks done by third parties for each release. <br />
<br />
Some of the more significant security features:<br />
<br />
*passwords are encrypted<br />
*all input field are filtered for valid entries<br />
*users' and course files are hidden from the Web <br />
*private courses can only be accessed by enrolled members<br />
*email addresses can be validated to be sure the person is who they say they are.<br />
*passwords are never sent by email (they must be reset by the user)<br />
<br />
...and range of other things</p>
