				<p>Hello folks. We decided to add icons to each course so they would display on the start page and on the course homepage.<br />
The problem is that on the start page the icon automatically becomes a clickable link to the course. Whilst this is good for sighted users, for visually impaired users, with screen reader, they now get the link twice. Once wrapped around the icon, followed by the linked course title.<br />
Has anyone addressed this problem already?<br />
Thanks</p>

				<p>We have looked at this. Its not as simple as it might seem to fix. We realize there's redundancy, but it would mean redesigning much of the My Courses page, which isn't something we can manage at the moment. <br />
<br />
If someone comes up with a solution, we'll consider adding it.  <br />
<br />
The file that needs modification is themes/default/users/index.tmpl.php</p>
