			<div class="body">
				<p>On My Start page there is the Current Activity box, that box shows some system generated news, such as when I have added a new quiz, and it shows the ammouncements that I have written. I would like to have it show only my own written announcements, no system generated info. I would expect there is a way to limit this through the mysql queries? I've been experimenting but haven't found a way to do it yet.<br />

				<p>Okay, I guess I'm not understanding what you mean by "system generated info" and "own written announcements". <br />
<br />
All elements in the Current activities are generated through the "module_news.php" file associated with each module.</p>

				<p>Ok, what I'm referring to are the notices created by the Atutor system, such as new quizes and tests, or announcements that I create myself. My desire is to prevent the entries that the system creates from being displayed, but I want my announcements displayed. So, in essence, changing the Current Activty listing to Announcements listing. <br />
<br />
I tried modifying every mysql query I could find that appeared to be related to that one db table but nothing I did had any effect on the Current Activity box.<br />
<br />
Maybe for the next verion update there can be a switch to enable/disable either of those types of messages. Or, provide the option of turning on a seperate box for announcements. Then make the two selectable as either shown or not shown on the My Start Page.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps<br />

				<p>There isn't a quick way to disable all except announcements. You would need to either add an exit; statement to the top of all the module_news.php files in the module directories, or disable current activity in system preferences and create something of your own that only displays announcements.</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>Thanks for the reply. I see there are 11 (if I remember correctly) module_news.php files. Just as a test I added the exit; just before the function announcements_news() line in the announcements/module_news.php file but it broke the Start Page so it displayed nothing. Upon removing the exit; statement the Start Page worked as normal. So, maybe there is more to it than just that one change? If I change all 11 files I'm sure the results will be the same - a broken Start Page, but I could be wrong about that. Please correct me.</p>

				<p>Try commenting out the whole function() in the module_news.php files<br />
<br />
/*<br />
function(){<br />
