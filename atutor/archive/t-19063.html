				<p>Hello everyone! Thank you for this really good site and LMS. It's really useful and relatively simple!<br />
T<br />
But i need to create special kind of tests like: start test and consolidation test. The point is that start test should be passed by student and it's compulsory condition of getting access to the learning stuff. Also there should be interim tests which are the must to get access to the consolidation test. Consolidation test shouldn't be allowed without passing all interim tests. Getting access to all of this tests should be given to students  automatically after passing start test. <br />
Thank you for your help!</p>

				<p>This will be a new feature in the upcoming release of 1.6.4. A beta will be available in a few days. There's a development version setup at the following URL if you want to have a look. You can assign prerequisite tests to folders, so when a test is taken or passed, content in the folder becomes available<br />

				<p>I tried that demo version and it works great to assign prerequisite tests but I failed to limit access to the consolidation test in condition on all others prerequisite tests had been taken or passed. Firstly I added link for the consolidation test from the edit content management of the page. Then i assigned some prerequisite tests for this page and the folder is still available to view, even though i assigned for that prerequisite tests.<br />
Is it possible to limit access to the consolidation test somehow or in such a way?<br />
P/S: i used 'another test' - 'browse courses' - 'getting started quiz' for testing this really useful feature of your demo version.</p>
