				<p>If you are asking for help, provide lots of detail so problems can be reproduced.<br />
<br />
Things to describe: <br />
  Operating system ATutor is installed on -<br />
  ATutor version -1.6.1<br />
  ATutor theme name -<br />
  PHP version -5.2.0<br />
  MySQL version -5.0.32<br />
  Webserver & version -apache2.2.3<br />
<br />
Hi<br />
I logged as an admin and got this warning in the first page.<br />
Warning: fsockopen() [function.fsockopen]: unable to connect to update.atutor.ca:80 (Network is unreachable)<br />
Also in the patcher  tab I got the following error:<br />
Warning: fsockopen() [function.fsockopen]: unable to connect to update.atutor.ca:80 (Network is unreachable) in .../ATutor-Test/mods/_standard/patcher/index_admin.php on line 62<br />
Error: Cannot connect to patch server: update.atutor.ca<br />
<br />
I should notice that my server is behind the pound, and has an invalid IP. I've tested it on the server with valid IP address and there was no error message. <br />
How can I solve the problem? Any idea?</p>

				<p>Yes, it's a problem for computers without direct Internet access. ATutor's dependency on the access to the atutor.ca site is growing in the latest versions, and that makes testing on such computers harder.<br />
<br />
You can comment out the lines that generate the errors (i.e. line 62 of mods/_standard/patcher/index_admin.php).</p>

				<p>thanks IndieRect.you mean that I can't use this new feature just because of invalid IP address.using pound because of security reason is a network security policy and the obligation to use valid IP address don't seems rational.</p>

				<p>Hi<br />
We at Ferdowsi university of Mashhad have done a lot of changes in ATutor for customization and always upgrade from older version to new one was troublesome.<br />
Using patcher feature can help us to upgrade our ATutor easier than before. But using an invalid IP address for our server is an obligation for us and it is a security policy. Now I want to ask whether it is possible to change patcher's code to work with invalid IP address. And if it is how can I do it?<br />
Any help will be appreciated.</p>

				<p>As IndieRect suggests you can comment out the line that connects to the patch server. There is actually a patch that will get rid of the error message, though I suppose its not much good if you can't connect the retrieve the patch. The other option might be to apply the patch manually, by copying it from the server and applying it yourself. Its #0005 for 1.6.1<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how the patcher would behave with an invalid IP, or how we might test that.</p>
