				<p>Hi,<br />
I have installed ATutor 1.4.2. The installation was fine and all of my system requirements were perfect for the install. When I went to login I noticed that my images for logo were not showing up (just the little red X where pictures should be). So I changed the location of the logos in my directory and then changed the images url in the config.inc.php<br />
They still did not show up. After hitting refresh 3 times I think to check and see if the logos were working I got this error	"An error occurred. Output sent before it should have. Please correct the above error(s). Headers already sent. Cannot initialise session." That was the extent of the error message.<br />
<br />
Can you tell me is this a bug? Where are my logos? And how can I now use the program as it won't go beyond this page. I'm somewhat experienced in installations and so on so this is not a stupid error on my part.<br />
Thanks!<br />
Holly</p>
