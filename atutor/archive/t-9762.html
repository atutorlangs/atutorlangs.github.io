				<p>[i]  Running AT version 1.5.3.3 on Apache-AdvancedExtranetServer/2.0.53 PHP/4.3.10[/i] <br />
<br />
I have noticed that ATutor seems to hang every now and then, particularly when I am saving something.  I have checked to see if this is related to the server and other programs are running ok.  <br />
<br />
There are no error messages appearing either. When this happens, I am unable to finish whatever I am working on and have to wait to re-login to the system.<br />
<br />
Is there anything I should check or any settings changes I could make to deal with this.  (Sorry for being so vague, but there doesn't seem to be any particular pattern to this problem.)</p>

				<p>It's unlikely to have anything to do with ATutor. <br />
<br />
It could be one of any number of problems from a failing disk, to network slowdowns, to a misconfigured web server or database...<br />
<br />
Examine your system's errors logs, and the ATutor admin's System Preferences>Error logging to see if you can find any clues there.<br />
<br />
You could try installing it on another system, preferably set up with the same php/apache/mysql combo to help rule out server software  problems.</p>
