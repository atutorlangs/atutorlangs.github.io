				<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I am wondering if there is a way (or a module) where I can create an account that has the ability to see results of users tests, and has the ability to enroll users, but not the ability to add / edit courses at all.<br />
<br />
Essentially I have group A, who has access to all courses, and can see results of every member within group A.<br />
<br />
Group B has access to all courses, and can see results of every member within group B.<br />
<br />
Both A & B cannot edit course content / questions though. <br />
<br />
Have I made this clear enough?</p>

				<p>There are only permissions to manage tests or not. There isn't a way distinguish between seeing marks and editing tests.<br />
<br />
All permissions are set in the course enrollment manager. Experiment with different permissions to see if it will give you what you need. Permissions are set course by course. You can't give access to all tests etc. with one setting.</p>
