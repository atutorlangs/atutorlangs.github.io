				<p>Hi,<br />
Sorry if this is in the wrong forum, wasn't sure.<br />
I work for a company that is  in need to moving its own proprietary desktop based lms system to online version. The way i see it is I have 2 options,<br />
1) Hire a company to develop an lms from scratch<br />
2) Use an open source like atutor or moodle and get it customise it.<br />
<br />
The lms we need is a very basic version of what moodle and atutor offer, basically we just need to be able to create courses, allow a manager to assign them to users, track those courses and then produce certificates.<br />
As we intend to sell this, I also need to be able to split users by Company - Department - Group<br />
Is atutor suitable for this?<br />
If so, know anybody interested in this proejct?<br />
Thanks,<br />
Ray</p>

				<p>ATutor is quite customizable right out ot the box. The tools provided in an installation, and the look of the system are pretty much fully customizable. If you do need features added, we, and other developers, can be hired to create them. Depending on the nature of the features, they may become part of the base source code, in which case they become part of the public domain, or in many cases propriatary features can be built into modules or themes, in which case you can choose to maintain full ownership over those features.<br />
<br />
There are restrictions on selling ATutor itself, but not on services associated with it, or content created with it. We encourage service providers to offer such services. We only ask that if you as a servcie provider require support from us, that you purchase a support package. Its only fair that if we are helping you generate revenues, you contribute part of that revenue back to ATutor.<br />
<br />
Of course if you can manage ATutor without our help, you are under no obligation at all to pay for anything.<br />
<br />
As for the features you mention, all exist in ATutor, oir as addon modules</p>
