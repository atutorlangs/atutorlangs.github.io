				<p>I would like to make the profile page static so students cannot make changes to it.  We are working on a project connecting Algerian high school students with US high school students and we need to limit the amount of information that is shared between the students.  I'm hoping by making the profile page static it will only show the information we provide rather than everything that a student may put in.  I tried changing the profile.tmpl.php file in the Themes folder, Default Folder, Users folder but that didn't seem to make any changes.  However when I changed the Preferences page in this same folder it worked for that page.  <br />

Any help would be much appreciated!  Thanks!!<br />
