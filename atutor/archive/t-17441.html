			<div class="body">
				<p>Hello.  I have 1.6.2 installed and patched.  I was wondering if it was possible to attach/link a file with a piece of content.  <br />
<br />
I would like to have things set up where content is to be released at a certain point, and have a file (i.e. and Excel doc.) that is linked to or associated with that content that wouldn't be available until the content is released.  Or is there a way to release files in the Course Files at certain times?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

				<p>Create a sub page for the content in question, and set its release date. Then use the Insert function in the popup file manager to add the file to the page.<br />
<br />
There isn't a file release date function otherwise.</p>

<br />
Thanks for responding.<br />
<br />
I tried that and with a Word doc. I got a "HTTP 404 Not Found" error when I tried to click on the link.<br />
<br />
When I tried that with an image file, it doesn't display the image.  It just has a red "x" with "Alternate Text" on the inside.<br />
<br />
The other aspects seem to be working though.  Could there be a problem with the file manager?  Or uploading files? <br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help.</p>

Thanks for the help.  I was waiting on submitting this info. until my site was fully transferred to a new webhost.<br />
<br />
Below is the info.......<br />
<br />
Things to describe: <br />
 Operating system ATutor is installed on - Linux CentOS (is this what you're looking for?)<br />
  Atutor version - 1.6.2<br />
  Patch #s applied - Fully patched<br />
  Atutor theme name - default<br />
  PHP version - 5.2.2<br />
  MySQL version - 5.1.30<br />
  Webserver & version - Unsure.  Host Gator is the webhost.<br />
  Copies of error messages - None<br />
  Changes to default settings - I've made some.  Too much to list, but the upload broke when my site was migrated to the [b]previous[/b] webhost, I don't think it's relevant. <br />
Browser - IE7<br />
<br />
Thanks again Greg.</p>

				<p>Using the content editor in HTML mode, adjust the path to the files. Find the file in the file manager to find its path.<br />
<br />
Linux, probably means you have an Apache 2 webserver.</p>
