				<p>I have a C++ course and facing a problem in showing something like this in HTML output:<br />
<br />
int array[10];<br />
for (int i=0 ; i&lt;10 ; ++i)<br />
   cout &lt;&lt; array[i];<br />
<br />
The problem is that in HTML output the [i] is omitted and the rest of text becomes italic. I know the problem is because [i] acts as &lt;i> in HTML, but I don't know how to disable it. Any help would be appreciated!</p>

				<p>Thanx!<br />
<br />
But the problem is that I have so many preformatted codes in HTML with lots of "&lt;" and so on which when I use "add code" they appear as they are and I must change all of them by hand. Is there any other way (like escape codes in C/C++, for instance using \[ to show [)?</p>

				<p>You could try escaping, but I don't think so.<br />
<br />
A text editor, using search and replace.</p>

				<p>As far as I remember, one of the reasons behind removing emoticons bar during content editing was that it was breaking too much things in usual content. I guess that in the same spirit the support for anything but pure HTML has to be removed from HTML-formatted content.<br />
<br />
A quick look at the code didn't show me how to do that though: the formatting set in constants.inc.php seems to be not working for that item (or 'content.text' which I looked at is not what's needed here).<br />
<br />
For now, there's really no better solution than to replace right brackets with "& # 91;" (without quotes and spaces).</p>
