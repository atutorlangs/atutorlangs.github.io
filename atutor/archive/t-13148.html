				<p>Hi I hope somebody can Help I am looking at adding a text box in the center of a content page this is not a markable question as there is no right or wrong answer<br />
how ever the text box needs to repopulate itself with the information the student entered each time they login.<br />
<br />
my question is can this be done in with the default modules or do I need maybe add the tables and code to the page manualy <br />
I hope I have explained myself will enough I am using ver 1.6</p>

				<p>Embedding a form would not be too much trouble, but collecting and displaying data in it would be.  Content pages are not intend for this type of thing. Other tools are available in ATutor for data collection.<br />
<br />
I don't understand the purpose of what your suggesting, so I'm not sure where to steer you. Can you describe in a little more detail, what you are trying to do.</p>

				<p>Sorry about not getting back sooner <br />
form was I think the wrong way to describe what I need.<br />
<br />
I shall try to explain a little clearer. the content page will include a text box that student can fill in with the answer to a question for example in one case they are asked to explan how they feel. I would like the anwser to the question to be added to a database agaist that students id so that the next time the student logs in the text box is populated with their anwser.</p>
