				<p>Do you experience any problems with finding time for answering the forum questions?<br />
<br />
It appears like nobody of ATutor.ca have viewed most of the forums for at least last 11 days. NO SINGLE REPLY has been posted to any of the forums since August 8th, except for the Bug Reports and Support ones.<br />
<br />
What's the matter? Many people NEED you not only in a rescue team role!</p>

				<p>There are replies everyday from joel, heidi, or myself, so I'm not sure where you got the idea that  we are not answerng forum messages. <br />
<br />
Remember that this is free support, and we provide help out of the goodness of our hearts. Free help does not come cheap for us. And, it does not need to be the ATutor team that always replies. If you can provide an answer for someone, please do. We help when we can, but this is a community forum, and the community should be helping each other. If people want garaunteed help, they can always purchase a support package from ATutor. Users should not rely on free support via the forums (even though it is pretty reliable)<br />
<br />
You may also notice that we are beginning to skip over help requests that provide insufficeint details. When people demonstrate they are willing to help themselves, we will help them. If we have to great effort to provide help where no details are provided, chances are these request will be skipped when we're busy.</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>Thank you for your answer. I appreciate your support, and do find it useful for many people, and (since providing technical support for ATutor in my University) really do understand how boring it is to answer questions asked for 10th time.<br />
<br />
I'm likely to have failed to present my thoughts clearly enough it the above post. I was quite emotional, and I see your reaction is emotional as much.<br />
<br />
The thing I'm concerned with is NOT a technical support. I do see on my own that you provide sufficient answers for all the problems reported, and kind assistance. Furthermore, I agree that your help is something more that could be expected based on its free status.<br />
<br />
But I'm speaking about other forum chapters, in which community members (e.g. developers, translators) ask you to perform some actions which require administrative access to ATutor.ca or the information which a priori is exclusively owned by you. In these cases, there is no alternative to your attention. Failing satisfy those requests may stuck their work and possibly become an argument for choosing other CMS.<br />
<br />
Since I understand you can't just ignore technical support requests of any nature as well as bug reports, I only ask you to at least balance your attention to them with sufficient attention to the other posts on this forum. Fortunately, there are much less of them.<br />
<br />
I hope that further community cooperation will be fruitful and successful.<br />
<br />
Wishing luck to you and your excellent project,<br />
