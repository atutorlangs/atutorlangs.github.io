				<p>Hi All<br />
<br />
I have installed for evaluation purposes ATutor Version 1.3 on a Redhat 8.0 server.  While I am in the process of customizing the LMS I noticed that most of the options are hard coded. For example if I want to hide a menu link or simply remove the user registration link from the login page I have to edit the relevant php file and modify it. Thats fine if I only have to do it once but what will happen if I upgrade in the future to a new version? Will I have to do the same modification all over again?<br />
I appreciate any feedback on what is the best way to customize the interface and retain the changes after upgrading to later versions in the future<br />

Thanks<br />

For now, any changes you make to the code will have to be redone when you upgrade, unless you make your change available for us to add to the next distribution. If you want to remove the registration link for instance, it must be an admin setting, and/or a course properties setting.<br />
<br />
You could always try submitting a feature request through the approriate forum. If others also find your request desirable, we will add it ourselves. The more people requesting, the more likely we are to add the feature.</p>
