				<p>Operating system ATutor is installed on - Darwin 10.8.0<br />
ATutor version - 2.0.3<br />
Patch #s applied - <br />
ATutor theme name - ATutor<br />
ATutor mobile theme name - Mobile<br />
PHP version - 5.3.8<br />

Copies of error messages - The following errors occurred: "Invalid login/password combination"<br />
<br />
When I try to log in locally (via a web browser on the server that ATutor is installed on), I can log in with username and password successfully.  However, when I try to log in from a remote computer, it does not allow me to log in.  From the remote computer, I can still access the site, create a user account (which successfully inserts into the db), modify password, etc.<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea what this problem could be?  Have you ever run into a similar issue?</p>

				<p>yes i can log in to both the admin and the instructor sites.<br />
<br />
if this helps, what is odd is that i can remotely create new user registrations and it stores the information on the database table. but then i can't log in with them remotely. i can only login on any account when i'm using the server which holds the install of atutor.</p>

				<p>Looking in the db members table, do the passwords appear as SHA1 40 character  strings. And if you reset a password manually in the db and save in SHA1 format, does that help?<br />

Also try deleting all ATutor related cookies, then try to login?<br />
<br />
If you try to login from some other remote system, does that make a difference?<br />
<br />
I this point I'm guessing. I've not seen this problem before, so it may be something specific to your installation, or browser, or the OS the browser is running on.</p>

				<p>I am in the same boat as the above user. I have removed all cookies from the computers that are trying to connect to my Atutor. I have checked the Database and the users are there as well as the encryption. Any remote access of the system over the web creates the same error. I can only log in on the localhost machine. <br />

				<p>Firewall related perhaps. I've been unable to reproduce the problem myself. <br />
<br />
IIS7 could be the issue, perhaps a setting. Though I've hading running fine on IIS7, others have reported issues. If you have an oppotunity, trying running with he Apache eb server.<br />
<br />
Also ATutor is untested with PHP5.5. Reverting to 5.4 may help.</p>
