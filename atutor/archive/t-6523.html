This is Piedad PInzon.  I am currently conducting a research on open source LCMS and with regards to ATutorI have some questions.  I would greatly appreciate your answers:<br />
<br />
1. In terms of developers, how many different roles do you have?  For instance, is there a release manager or test manager?  Is there a chief architect?<br />
<br />
2. Does the University of Toronto use ATutor?  If so, how many users can we count?<br />
<br />
3. How many core developers does ATutor have?</p>

				<p>1. In terms of developers, how many different roles do you have?  For instance, is there a release manager or test manager?  Is there a chief architect?<br />
<br />
[green] Roles are fairly fluid. Depending on the task, we all take on multiple roles. There is a "chief architect", a lead programmer, and graphic design coordinator, as well as general programmers... [/green]<br />
<br />
2. Does the University of Toronto use ATutor?  If so, how many users can we count?<br />
<br />
 [green]Yes, but only minimally. UofT has had a WebCT license for several years. The move to ATutor will be slow. There are several small pockets of groups using ATutor at UofT now, but I could only guess how many users are on these systems. [/green]<br />
<br />
3. How many core developers does ATutor have? <br />
<br />
 [green]five (though that varies up and down from cycle to cycle) [/green]<br />
