				<p>Hello.  I was wondering if there is currently a way to allow for partial credit when multiple answer questions are corrected automatically.  Like the way it gives partial credit for ordering questions.  Like this.....<br />
<br />
Select all answers that are true.<br />
A. 1 + 1 = 2<br />
B. 3 + 4 = 7<br />
C. 3 + 2 = 9<br />
<br />
Let's assume that this question is worth 4 pts. and the person answering it just chose "A".  I would want this person to get 2/4 in both of the scenarios I described since they correctly identified one of the correct ans. choices.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</p>

				<p>hia, that's the proper way to do it I believe, and we changed it on our install. have a look at:<br />
<br />
http://atutor.no/2009/05/improving-multiple-answer-question-type<br />
<br />
..I realise we might not have released / described the code changes there, but let me know if that will solve your issue and I'll post the code to do it at atutor.no <br />
<br />
(BTW: we also have a script to update old test results)</p>
