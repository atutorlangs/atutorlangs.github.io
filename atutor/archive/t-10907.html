				<p>I'm planning on using A tutor as an e-learning program for my company.  So far, I like A tutor a lot but would like to ask one very important question.  I'm planning on using powerpoint as a resource, maybe also flash, is there a way to add powerpoint presentations or flash presentation as "lessons" in Atutor?<br />

				<p>You should have no trouble with Flash or powerpoint. For Flash, use the authoring tool to generate the HTML needed to embed the Flash in a page. Then upload the Flash files into the ATutor File Manager, paste the HTML generated by the authoring tool into an ATutor content page, and adjust the paths to the Flash files in the HTML. There also an example in the demo site, if you login and look for Flash and Object Embedded in the menu<br />

<br />
For ppt file, upload the files into the File Manager, then while using the popup File manager, with the Content Editor, press the insert button beside the ppt files to insert a link into a content page. Students click the link, and open the file into a local installation of Powerpoint.</p>

				<p>If you are asking for help, provide lots of detail so I am not sure I fully understand what you are saying. I too would like to use PPT to provide content. I have Atutor loaded to my Godaddy server account (Linux) and logged in. I opened the File Manager icon and uploaded the ppt file to it. I cannot find a File Manager "popup." I then opened Content Editor but do not see any insert button. I must be in the wrong spot. Can you tell me where to go to make this work? My goal is to have, in the content window on the right side of the screen, all of the content. Once a link there is clicked I would like for it to open the content in the main window (like it does) and then have a link to the PPT presentation. Is this possible?<br />
