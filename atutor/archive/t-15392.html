With all due respect I appreciate the work being done here. But my adventures made me stumble into some unexpected site this morning.<br />
<br />
It is also providing open source services. I think you guys can get a lot of ideas from their code. Their functionality is squeezed into buttons. Just a click away. Beautiful interface etc. Infact their work makes ATutor look AMATEURISH, I called them and they said they were located in Greece. <br />
<br />
Youtube, DimDim, etc all that comes thru the click of a button. No hassles.<br />
<br />
According to my proclivities, Greg is arrogant but now I found a comforter. So Greg suck ma DICK, cuz this is BROOKLYN</p>

				<p>All respect, huh?<br />
I just hope the ATutor team won't take that manner of showing respect too seriously.<br />
<br />
Good luck in getting that CMS up from where you put it with such an, hmmm..., "aggressive marketing".</p>

				<p>On a forum I moderate I use to strip off links and most severe profanities and let it hang there as a scarecrow and target for our users -- they get a "legal" outlet for irony and sarcasm. :)<br />
