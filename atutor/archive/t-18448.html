				<p>If you are asking for help, provide lots of detail so problems can be reproduced.<br />

I am having a problem with the ATutor Payments Module. The Cheque payments functionality was working fine until ATutor 1.6.2, but it is not working in 1.6.3.<br />
<br />
Although the Payment through Paypal is working fine.<br />
<br />
I have added the Cheque Payment Address in the Settings of the ecomm module.<br />
<br />
Whenever a user clicks on Pay by Cheque (payment.php), a pop-up is displayed (invoice.php) which should show the Cheque payment details with invoice id ...but in 1.6.3 it just says the Page cannot be displayed)<br />
<br />
any idea what i can do to correct this?<br />
<br />
Best regards</p>

				<p>I don't think anything has changed with submitting  cheques in the Payments module.<br />

Have you tried with the default theme? Or a different browser?</p>

				<p>Thank you Greg,<br />
<br />
I did try using the Default Theme as you told me, as well as IE 6.0 instead of IE 7.0 which i was using, but it didnt work.<br />
<br />
However i have noticed that although the pop-up is not giving the cheque details yet in Admins, the payment shows to have been made, which means an invoice id is being generated.<br />
<br />
The number of times i click on " Pay by Cheque" it created a new invoice id and increments it, however doesnt show up on the invoice window.<br />
<br />
However thanks for the help. <br />
<br />
I will post back if i have any luck with it.<br />
<br />
Regards</p>
