				<p>Hello,<br />
I am using ATutor 1.4.2 online (through the regular website) for my course. I have put several files in the course space I created using the file manager (files include .pdf, .ppt, .rtf, .doc, and more). I have only used a small fraction of my space with the files.  Up until the middle of last week these files opened fine from the file manager or from the links I created. However, about mid-week last week the files would no longer open. I keep getting 404 pages. Ive tried this on at least 3 computers running Windows NT and in MS Explorer and Firefox. My students have also tried on various computers and browsers, all with no success. <br />
<br />
Any idea what is happening, why, and what I can do about it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

				<p>I'm guessing you mean on http://courses.atutor.ca. The server was recently moved and a setting was missed during the transfer. It should be working now.</p>
