				<p>Hi Greg~<br />
<br />
Under "administrator" - "Users" I seem to be able to delete only one student at a time.  Is there a way to select multiple students and delete them all at once?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.<br />
<br />

				<p>Unenrolling does not remove the student from the system. Administrators can only currently remove them from the system one at a time.<br />

				<p>A similar thing, just in case you decide to implement it.<br />
Our users requested a feature that would allow instructors to delete all the test submissions for the alumni. Of course, it could be applied as well to forums, inbox, blogs, file storage etc.<br />
So, to generalize, it would be nice to see a feature to sweep the course manually, or even this way: making a student alumni deletes all his info in the course (maybe as an option).</p>
