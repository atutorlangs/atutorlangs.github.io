Hi everybody!<br />
i'm new to atutor and here is the deal. <br />
I will be using atutor in a school along with the general classes and the teachers and parents would like to use it a bit widely than just the online classes. the scenario is as follows.<br />
1. Teachers would like to be able to upload the marks every day for every student and every class. Not only for courses and tests that are present in Atutor.<br />
2. They would prefer (if possible) that each student could see only his/her marks when logged in.<br />
3. Teachers would also like to sometimes comment each student's progress.<br />
<br />
From what i have learned, gradebook is not the best option for this. The detailed advice of experienced guys would be highly appreciated.</p>

				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I'd say that's a typical school scenario of gradebook usage.<br />
<br />
I think you'll need either to modify the existing gradebook, or develop a new tool (as we did, even though we had a bunch of other requirements to justify that effort).<br />
<br />
Also think about using some existing ATutor tool or Web 2.0 tool for that purposes, like perhaps Google Calendar.</p>

				<p>Hello!<br />
thanks for your reply! I think it is not the case when development or modifying will be appreciated - we are kind of pressed for time and I have to look for some ready solution. I will definitely look into the options Google Calendar suggests, but could you be more specific about Atutor tools you mentioned in your post? <br />
As i said, i'm totally new to atutor so i'm afraid integrating some third party tool into it might take more time than adjusting the existing (if that's the case) atutor tool...<br />
thanks again for your replies</p>

				<p>The ATutor Gradebook will do 1 & 2  you've described, though comments would need to be posted separate from the gradebook.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest you try it, and see if it gives you what you need. Or if Indie wants to package up his custom gradebook, maybe you could try his.</p>

				<p>Actually, our gradebook doesn't allow commenting on student progress; we didn't have such a requirement.<br />
<br />
As for the existing tools, there's no exact match for your requirements, which is why I suggested to just try some.<br />
<br />
I suppose that you want the comments to be private just like marks should be, right?<br />
If so, then [i]technically[/i] you can do that by, say, creating a group for each student and enabling a forum for that group (in the group settings). Thus, each student would see an additional forum, access to which would be restricted to himself and the instructor. As a bonus (or a drawback, depending on your needs), the student would be able to fully [i]discuss[/i] the marks using the forum engine.<br />
Of course, this solution isn't very scalable and would probably work well only for small number of students.<br />
Same trick can be done with blogs.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you could have a look at the internal mail (Inbox link at the top right corner) and perhaps groups in the social network tool.</p>

				<p>Thanks so much, guys! i can see now that the forum thing  that Indie described will do pretty much what we need. at least for now. as the project expands we will look into other options and maybe develop something on our own.<br />
Thanks again for your prompt responses. i would call this issue resolved.</p>
