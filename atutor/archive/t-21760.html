				<p>I think I found the problem. HTML-Visual Editor has some bugs. If I do it writing in HTML codes it saves it correctly and works fine. When I do it with using HTML-Visual tools it looks as if it works ok till saving the work. But saving make a mess everthing. <br />

				<p>I met with a complaint which is exactly same with mine mentioned above on the URL "http://www.joomlablogger.net/joomla-tips/joomla-extension-tips/tinymce-respecting-settings/"<br />
----<br />
The problem one Swedish user had was as follows: He inserted a picture, entered settings for alignment, horizontal space etc. and everything looked good. Happily he saved the article. When he looked at the article again, all the formatting was gone. What happened?<br />
<br />
This is actually very easy to fix. TinyMCE has a setting for stripping code from the text when saving. It's called "Code Cleanup on save".<br />
<br />
Go to Plugin Manager and Editor - TinyMCE 2.0. You'll find the setting under Plugin Parameters. The setting should be set to "Never".<br />

<br />
So, friends, what should I do to overcome the problem? I don't how to correct the settings of tinymce editor in Atutor.<br />

				<p>tinyMCE settings are stored in include/lib/tinymce.inc.php<br />
<br />
I think you can add "cleanup: false" or something into the settings there to manually turn it off.  I haven't checked what the exact code should be like on tinyMCE.  You can try searching for it on Google or tinyMCE and add it yourself.<br />
<br />
Another note is on the 4th row in our tinyMCE, the second last button from the right has a button called "cleanup messy code".  I think that is the function you are looking for.</p>
