				<p>Hi All<br />
I think this is somthing poploe have asked befor but i hope i word it a little better. I have some content i have created in authorware so i have placed this content in the content directory of said course and created links to it. The problem being is that when the content is expoted the export engine only exports the content which is named in the pages ie as hyperlinks etc andy any files that are not named in the pages are left behind is ther anyway to make the the export engine export the whole content directory<br />
<br />
    Any help or advice would be fantastic as i am not a coder or php god the only way roud it i have come up with is to plcae a page at the end of my course as a referance to all the content that sould be included in order for it to be xported</p>

				<p>How would your students access the authorware content? I'm assuming a link in a content page allows them to download the file. If you export the page with the link in it, the packager will find the authorware content and create a content package. Exporting the entire content directory would be undesirable in most cases, particularly if you are exporting smaller units within a course as content packages.	<br />
<br />
One thing ATutor content export can not deal with (nor can other utilities of this sort) is internally defined files accessed via binary content. You might try creating hidden links within the page containing the link to your authorware content, that link to the files it calls.</p>
