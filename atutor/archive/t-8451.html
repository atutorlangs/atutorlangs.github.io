				<p>Good morning,<br />
<br />
Seems I could use ATutor to run educationnal courses on french gastronomie.<br />
<br />
Could you kindly tell me if my ATutor content can be hosted on the server where I host my website ? <br />
<br />
My Host (Dreamhost) makes Sql available if I need and runs Apache if requested. <br />
<br />
But I do not understand what I should put on Dreamhost.<br />
<br />
Will ATutor appear as one of my website ? Is there a<br />
portion of ATutor software to install on Dreamhost?<br />
<br />
If you could give me steps to follow about what to donwload on my PC, then FTP/install on Dreamhost, I would really appreciate.<br />
<br />
Also I am not clear whether I can also install ATutor on my XP machine and develop my content there, before uploading to Dreamhost.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much</p>
