Things to describe: <br />
<br />
  version of ATutor - 1.5.3.3<br />
 <br />
I am setting access to my courses to be "Protected" since I only want people with user logins to access content pages. I also want to force them to enroll in a course since I want to track their usage statistics, primarily content page hits and access dates. However, I do not want to be required to approve their enrollment. I can force enrollment by making a code change but is there another way to do this?  It seems like there should be another access option between "Protected" and "Private" defined as:  "Available only to users with an ATutor System Account. Login required. Enrollment required." <br />

Thanks, Sandie</p>

				<p>I need to do this to. Any tips where I should hack at? Is it just some php script that changes a field for every one in MYSQL for course id 1? <br />
<br />
Also I only have one course the students access. How do I remove the browse course, create course links from the My Start page?<br />
