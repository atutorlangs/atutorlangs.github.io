				<p>hello fellows,<br />
<br />
<br />
I just noticed that the content.php page has a #content anchor, and i would like to know if theres any option on admin/nstructor panels to "activate" it, as my content pages are basically slides (.jpg) and often need a little down-scroll on the screen... with this option, i assume that when i access any content, i'll "jump" to the #content (below the content title), without the down-scroll thing :) :) :) <br />
<br />
By the way, yes i've already surfed through admin and instructor options but didnt noticed it :( <br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers =D</p>

				<p>The content anchor is there for assistive technology users, who will notice the link to it in the upper left (a bypass link) when their assistive technology begins reading the page, or if they tab into the page (it's the first link). It can also be accessed uing the alt-c accesskey. <br />
<br />
There is no admin option to automatically jump the the anchor, though if you're creating links to your pages, you could include the anchor in the URL. Jumping to the content top when the page loads would be disruptive for most people so its unlikely we'd make it an option. At least not an admin option, but perhaps a content author option associated with specific pages.</p>

				<p>Hmmm i see.<br />

Thanks Greg. I think i'll make it then: an option on admin panel to turn on/off this, and when its on, i simply put the #contet thing on the content links :P :P <br />
