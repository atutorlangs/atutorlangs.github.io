				<p>We are interested inusing your sfotware in order to post preparation tests for our participants on our webiste. I was unable to find specific features on the testing capabilities. We are looking for a test that offers the following:<br />
<br />
Timed test, ability for testers to pause and resume the test, the ability to skip questions and return to them later, to allow the tester to take the test as many times as needed within a 60 day period, to browse/review the questions during and after the exam, for the template to show # of questions remaining and time remaining, to set a passing score, and for the test taker to take the test on windows 95 or higher. Does the ATutor test creator offer these features?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.</p>
