			<div class="body">
				<p>I have read through every thread of this forum regarding the "Unable to open content directory" error. I have tried the various solutions (chown nobody:nobody/chmod a+rwx content) that have been suggested but to no avail. Even the change on line 138 which was outlined in the bug fixes for Atutor 1.1. was applied. However, regarding that particular fix for file_manager.php, it's not clear if this line needs to be added in the script or if it replaces a particular line. Is there anyone who could give me some direction or suggestion as to how to fix this issue. Thanks.<br />
<br />
P.S. Otherwise all else seems to be working.</p>

				<p>Thanks for responding so promptly.  Unfortunately, ATutor is residing on our internal network and is not mapped to the outside.  However, I created a copy of the phpinfo() and saved it in html.  It's available at the following site: http://library.olhcc.edu/winnebago/test.html  Thanks.<br />

				<p>The first time, I imported the "How To Atutor" to create a new class.  However, I marked the class as public.  That's when I had the error "Unable to open content directory."  So, I deleted the course and imported it again but this time marked it as  "protected."   No problem ... I was able to use the file manager.  Is there an issue with the public access and file manager? <br />
Thanks.</p>
