				<p>Hello!<br />
[green]...Our company is the elearning provider. We are regional partners of such world famous companies, as NETg, Q Group PLC, Trivantis Corporation. Now we search LMS in which possible to host SCORM-courses of all these companies. I tried to import these courses in ATutor (v.1.5.2), but the content in each case was displayed incorrectly. Whether you can help me? What your conditions and how many can cost such services? I can upload examples of courses on our FTP if necessary. [/green] <br />

Lectora produces very broken HTML markup. If you copy the HTML source from a Lectora content frame and pass it through the W3C validator, you will see what I mean.<br />

<br />
There are other issues with using Lectora content, one being it forces users to view the content in a framed environment. ATutor does not use Frames. While you *can not* view Lectora content as imported "content", you should be able to view the content as an imported "package" using the Packages tools. But because the markup is broken, it does not display properly.<br />
<br />
We recommend using Reload as a SCORM authoring tool<br />
