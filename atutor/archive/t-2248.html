				<p>We are considering switching to ATutor from WebCT and I need to be able to generate a monthly report from ATutor that shows how many new enrollments we have had in each course every month.  From looking at the ATutor database I don't see where a course enroll date is stored.  Am I missing it?  I figure that I can modify the php scripts to capture a date and add an enroll_date field to the course_enrollment table but don't want to do that if I can find the information somewhere.  Also, if I need to update the scripts am I correct in thinking that the following three files are the only ones where the course_enrollment table is updated - \users\create_course.php; \users\enroll.php; and private_enroll.php? <br />

Thanks, Sandie</p>

				<p>There's no collection of enrollment dates currently, though that would be fairly easy to add. Suggest it to the Feature Requests forum so it gets recorded and included in a future release.<br />
<br />
Run the following command to find all references to the course_enrollment table:<br />
<br />
> grep -R course_enrollment /path/to/ATutor/*<br />
<br />
Some references may be relevant, others not.<br />
<br />
Or if you're on windows, use the find in file utility</p>
