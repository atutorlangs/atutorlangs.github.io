				<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
The way we have this setup is that a number of clicks must happen before the player actually launches.<br />
<br />
This is causing people to think the system isnt as user friendly as it should be.<br />
<br />
From a top level page, is there a way I can embed some javascript to have the SCORM player auto load? Even if we have to manually set the course and package IDs?</p>

				<p>The SCORM module is a third party module. The maintainer hasn't been maintaining it, so we're hoping someone will take ownership and continue its development. <br />
<br />
Our efforts are focused on maintaining IMS interoperability standards in ATutor.<br />
<br />
If you do come up with a solution, we can probably add it to the publicly distributed module.</p>

				<p>Hi Greg,<br />
<br />
Thank you for getting back to me. <br />
<br />
Is this something that perhaps you or another developer would be interested in doing as a paid service?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

				<p>I'm a little reluctant to say yes, we'd do it. Not being totally familiar with the module's code, its difficult to estimate the effort that might be involved. <br />
<br />
Maybe you can contact the original developer to do the work. The more feedback he gets about his module, the more likely he'll want to spend a little more time maintaining it. And, if there's a few dollars in it for him, all the better.<br />

His name's Matthai Kurian, and his Web site is at. http://yastut.com/</p>
