				<p>Hello, I've tried to upload several files at once in the file manager using the multi-file uploader tool, but every time that I press the "browse files" button, I get no response. The button does no action. <br />
<br />
I saw in the documentation that for this feature to work, the browser must have a flash plugin. But I checked that my browser does have the "Shockwave Flash Object" add-on installed and enabled (screenshot attached).<br />
<br />
Should I install another form of flash plugin or is it a problem of another sort?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your assistance. By the way, my gratitude to Greg an IndieRect for your help on my previous question on math content editing. That really solved it.<br />

				<p>hi, this feature is a bit shaky I believe, atleast if you have a Mac. see my post here: http://www.atutor.ca/view/3/16976/1.html</p>

				<p>Well, I see the problem is not on my end. But I'll tell you that I'm not on a Mac. This is a PC using WinXP and IE7. So this uploader tool may be in need of an overhaul.<br />
<br />
Well, nothing's perfect. ATutor's features are still scoring very high for me. Guess, I'll wait for the new version to see a better uploader tool. For now, I'll have to add one by one (in groups of 30!:() my files.<br />
<br />
Thanks vegard.</p>

				<p>The MFU is a part of the Fluid libraries (fluidproject.org) and their first implementation. There have been several new Fluid releases since the last ATutor release, so we're hoping the MFU won't be quite so browser dependent when we upgrade to the current Fluid libraries when the next ATutor comes out (June/July).<br />
<br />
There's always the single file uploader.</p>
