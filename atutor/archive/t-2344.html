				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
ATutor haves many things in common with traditional Content Management System... I'm very impressed with the course management but I was wondering how if I could add static html modules/content (like in PostNuke) ? Or, as on this site, I should create separate static html/php pages (with same layout) to handle my personalized static content ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

In my implementation of ATutor, I have done both.  <br />
<br />
I have static html pages (eg.Course Outcomes) that are linked to from within the ATutor content pages.I simply use a BACK button to send them back to the sending ATutor page.<br />
<br />
Our system is wrapped in PostNuke via pnATutor, thus allowing  seemless access to student lessons, while using PostNuke modules for threaded discussions (that include audio and video), journals (that include audio and video and are readable by only the student and instructor), calendar of events, an ePortfolio, booking synchronous audio-video chat rooms, and receiving realtime tech support (as well as using a ticketing system if the operator can not be reached).<br />
<br />
With some wonderful help (thanks to Eileen at TorontoWebHosting), I was finally able (yesterday) to get ATutor to operate totally within PostNuke, doing away with double scrollbar issues.<br />
<br />
cheers<br />
