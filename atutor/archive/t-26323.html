				<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I have created a demo site with 3 public courses. When I visit the course for the first time I'm able to see the course details. But when I browse to other part of the site and try to visit the course again, it prompts me to log in although the course is public. I'm not able to view the course anymore until I delete my cookies. After that I'm able to view it again but only once. <br />
<br />
The issue also occurs on another computer and different browsers.<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

				<p>Are you able to reproduce the problem on the demo site:<br />

I don't have a good answer for you. You may be able to trace the problem using something like Firebug.</p>

				<p>No, your site is not showing this behavior. I have checked with Firebug and it's showing some cookie error. <br />
<br />
Can you please check it yourself: http://learndemy.com/courses/browse.php<br />
<br />
Click on any Public course and you will be able to see it. Then click on the top link "Browse courses" again (don't hit the back button) and then try to visit the same course again. It will prompt you to log in.<br />
<br />
What can be the issue?</p>

				<p>I have attached admin logins. But you don't need to be logged to reproduce the problem. <br />
<br />
I have just recorded a video: https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cbjoqyldHm<br />
<br />
Can you please confirm that by following the same steps from the video, everything works fine for you? You are able to view public videos more than 1 time?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

				<p>Yes, the steps I took were exactly as described in the video, though after clicking Browse Courses, then trying to get back to the course, I was then taken back into the course instead of receiving the login message.<br />
<br />
Have you tried the same steps from a different computer, or maybe a different operating system (e.g. Mac), or perhaps from a different network? <br />
<br />
Now change your admin password.</p>

				<p>Yes, I have tried from several computers and all 4 browsers. I have tried from different network. I only didn't try from other OS like Mac.<br />
<br />
Can my timezone (Croatia) have something with this? Can it affect the cookies somehow?<br />
<br />
Also, the firebug is showing some cookies issue, did you saw?</p>

				<p>You could try adjusting the timezone. And, do check to be sure the server time is set correctly.</p>
