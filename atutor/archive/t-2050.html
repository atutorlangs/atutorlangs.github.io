				<p>I checked your installation documentation v carefully both install and config pages and assumed there'd be more in the readme or in the main script file when I'd downloaded it. Couldn't find much more though.<br />
<br />
Normally when I install scripts I have to put in mysql details, script filepaths and change permission/s before anything at all can work.<br />
<br />
Anyway I thought perhaps instead you had some preliminary GUI interface that would operate when I'd uploaded.<br />
<br />
The only likely candidate in your instructions seemed to be ATutor/include/config.inc.php<br />
<br />
but If I try viewing it in my ftp file handler where it is	<br />
foresthouse/ATutor/include/config.inc.php<br />
I get<br />
&lt;?php /* This file is a placeholder. Do not delete. Use the automated installer. */ ?><br />
<br />
No instructions on what this automated installer is or where to find it &lt;small weep><br />
<br />
I tried browsing to http://www.shansweb.co.uk/foresthouse/atutor/<br />
as that seemed like the best possibility as an "auto installer" <br />
and just in case of case sensitivity<br />
http://www.shansweb.co.uk/foresthouse/ATutor/<br />
<br />
both get 404<br />
<br />
Happy to help with documentation later on when I understand what to do. I'm good at explaining on basic level.<br />
<br />
love and thank you<br />

				<p>Have set permissions as open as I can on the config.inc.php file, no better though. Should they be 766 or 755?<br />
