				<p>Apologies if there is another thread on this, I did a search but couldn't find a relevant thread.<br />
<br />
   I'm having an issue with setting up assignments. <br />
<br />
Basically we have something like Year 7 Physics Course which we have under a sub-category Physics, of the category Science. I have in there several classes of children, which I have created as a group such as Port, Channel, etc. Each week during their GCSE course I set an assignment, which the student works on which becomes a section of their coursework. And I like them to submit this work to me, I give them feedback and a mark, they improve their work submit back and the circle repeats until they have a very good mark for learning potential. <br />
<br />
   Firstly how can I set up assignments in such a way that I can give all of that Class the same assignment, but the individual only has access to the piece he uploads and myself without other students being able to edit his own work! Some of my classes being different standards receive different assignments btw. <br />
   <br />
Secondly how can I give comments to the work that they hand-in and for them to be able to see these comments and thus edit their work, to create a new revision, to re-submit to me for further feedback and marking. Although under the assignment hand-ins I can create comments, but the student doesn't seem to be able to see them on his work. Am I looking in the wrong location?<br />
<br />
Many thanks</p>

				<p>Firstly: students should store private files in My Files. Group files are accessible to all group members. From My Files they would click Hand In, to submit an assignment file<br />
<br />
Secondly: yes comments are not showing up.  We'll look into it.</p>

				<p>Thanks Greg I noticed later on that it seemed to be acting like a bug. Same as the unenroll feature although told in settings to be off still works. I just removed it from the code in the end. All in all very nice piece of software.<br />
  Two more questions then if a student is a member of a group that ive created like class 1. And i set an assignment to the entire group. Is he able to hand-in work from his My Files directory in File Manager. Or does the assignment have to be set to all student on its creation?<br />
   Secondly is it possible to have more than one instructor on a course. I noticed theres something called assistants but cant seem to find where i add them.<br />
 Many thanks again.</p>

				<p>Have you found the Handbook yet? Rather than me trying to explain here, most things are already explained there.<br />
<br />
Assignments can be set to all students or to a group. A group could potentially be a single student.<br />
<br />
Assign all privileges to an enrolled course member to create another instructor in the enrollment manager.</p>
