				<p>I've recommended that some of my clients look at ATutor as an option to commercial systems, and one of the main questions is scalability. Can one ATutor installation run multiple clients with multiple course databases? Also, what is the maximum user base for a single installation (assuming maximum hardware is available). Is it easy to move courses/objects from one installation to another?<br />

				<p>On highend hardware and Internet connectivity ATutor should easily handle hundreds, perhaps thousands, of simultaneous connections, and the number of students and courses on a system are limited only by the size of the storage device where the ATutor databases reside. <br />
<br />
We have not had any reports from users of ATutor in large implementations (we are still pretty new), so this is an educated guess based on our experience with small and medium size implementations. We'd like to think that ATutor can handle any size implementation.<br />
<br />
As far as multiple course databases is concerned, all courses can be contained in a single database, or contained in multiple databases if needed. <br />
<br />
Multiple instances of ATutor can be installed using the same database. During installation database table prefixes can be defined to create unique tables for as many ATutor installations needed. Database access ports can also be defined in the configuration options for multiple installations on a single server to distribute access across multiple databases if necessary.<br />
<br />
Moving content from system to system is easy using the ATutor import/export tools. Content from whole courses, course units, or even single pages can be transferred using the content packaging tools. Content packages can also be viewed offline. Content can also be imported from other IMS/SCORM compliant systems, and visa versa. Entire courses with tests, forum definitions, resources links, glossary terms etc. can also easily  be transferred between ATutor systems using the backup tools.<br />
<br />
If you have a specific example requiring scalability, I can describe how ATutor will scale.<br />
