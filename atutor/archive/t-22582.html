				<p>Hi, <br />
Jusr upgraded to the latest release - all went well until copying ocntent over at which stage the page stayed empty for some time - seemed to have lost connection. I refreshed the page and all content import appeared to be successful. The upgrade was successful. However, on logging in to a course, all content pages have a red cross beside them , with the following error on the page:<br />
<br />
Warning: preg_replace() [function.preg-replace]: Compilation failed: unrecognized character after (? at offset 2 in /home/mycourse/htdocs/ATutor/include/lib/output.inc.php on line 808<br />
<br />
When copying over the new ATutor files to the new directory, I did get a couple of script errors - may this be related ?.<br />
<br />
Any ideas to assist would be most welcome.<br />
Thanks<br />
Jim</p>

				<p>When you say copied over new ATutor files, do you mean you FTP'd files one by one? Doing so is quite prone to errors. <br />

				<p>Thanks for getting back to me Greg - yes that's what I did - FTPd the whole atutor folder.<br />

I've deleted it now - I'll send over the zip file and ask our webhost to unpack it for us and try again.<br />

				<p>Disaster !<br />
<br />
Hi Greg, after deletion of the new ATutor folder, I renamed the old one back to the original and we now have many missing content. Some pages in courses have been duplicated - the duplicate page has no content.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I backed up each course. Today I restored one from backup and it is completely empty apart from some images in File Manager. <br />
<br />
Just contacting our web host to see if we can get a restore of our server organised.<br />
<br />
Appreciate any help here.</p>

				<p>Oops. Did not see your latest reply.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping you have this resolved. I'm not certain what's gone wrong. What you've described we've not encountered before. It makes sense though, that your Internet connection may have been dropped while in the middle of the upgrade.<br />
<br />
If you created a backup of the database as instructed when upgrading, you would also need to restore it in addition to restoring the old code.<br />
<br />
If you have backups of all your courses, you could potentially start with a fresh install of ATutor, then restore your courses. This would not restore any course data however that was generated in the course interacitons, like forum threads, test results, file storage etc.</p>

				<p>Hi Greg, <br />
No worries - I asked our web host to restore our website and database from a backup, so all is back to normal. They have agreed to unpack the new Atutor to our server when ready, so that is probably a better way to start the upgrade as you suggested. Just waiting for an opportune moment to have another go at it.<br />
Thanks for getting back to me.<br />
