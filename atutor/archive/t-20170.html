				<p>I just started using Atutor and created several top level pages.  <br />
<br />
I am trying to move some to be subtopics but I can't seem to move them.<br />
<br />
The instructions say to: <br />
"Select the radio button of the content you want to move. Use the After:  and Before:  buttons to place this topic after or before the selected location, respectively. Use the + button to add this topic as a child of the selected location. "<br />
<br />
There is no + button but I can see the before and after buttons.  I tried using the + sign on both paces on the keyboard (keypad and shift = but to no avail)<br />
<br />
There seems to be no way in my system to create sub pages.<br />
<br />
Can you tell me what is wrong?  I have attached a screenshot.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Operating system ATutor is installed on - apache 2.2.9<br />

				<p>Hello ebusinesstutor,<br />
<br />
I think you need to add a container for sub page content from the side bar (can't see where else you can do this from)<br />
<br />
In the side panel navigation (enable it if you've turned it off/it isn't already visible) you should see the "Content Navigation" panel; to the top right of this panel are 3 small icons "Add Top Folder", "Add Top Page" & "Enter Edit Mode".<br />
<br />
"Add Top Folder" will create a folder (as you might expect). You can then move top level pages into the sub section(s) you have just created in the "Arrange Content" tab.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
