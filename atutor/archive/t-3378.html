				<p>Let's take for example a common case in many languages: if we have a glossary term which is [i] felino[/i]  but it also appears on the course text as [i]felinos [/i] , [i] felina[/i] , [i]felinas [/i] ... how can I manage that and link it with [?] codes to [i]felino[/] definitions without having to repeat the entry?<br />
<br />
I've tried with [i]related-to[/i] option at glossary term, but it does not allow to just relate and have an empty definition. Besides, even if I can use it by filling definitions with dummy texts, the related entry does not apper as usual when you move the cursor over that alternate terms, just the dummy definition.<br />
<br />
Isn't there a better way to handle synonymous words at ATutor?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
PS: Of course I'm using [i][?]felino[/?]s[/i] option but it's only a solutions for plurals.</p>

				<p>I've detected a related problem: when you define a term in a non-English language which uses some acute accent for example, let's say [i]pgina[/i], when you try to use [?] to link it from a content page when it's written as [i]p&amp;aacute;gina[/i] it does not recognize it as the same word...<br />
<br />
If synonymous were implemented it could be solved making both ways of writting the word synonymous.</p>

It's unlikely we will get your gloassary suggestion into the coming release, but it is a good idea, and we'll consider it for a future release.</p>

				<p>Sorry, I didn't followed the instructions! :-(<br />
<br />
I'm running ATutor 1.4.2 + PHP a v4.3.10 + Apache a v1.3.33.<br />
<br />
I guess you refer to HTML entities problem...<br />
<br />
And thanks for consider my synonymous suggestion for future releases! :-)<br />
