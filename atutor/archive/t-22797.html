				<p>Hi.  I have ATutor 2.0 installed and I've noticed that when a valid image file type is uploaded, you can view the image by clicking "Edit".  However, if the file extension is in CAPS, it fails.  <br />
<br />
Pic.JPG --> Not visible with edit<br />
Pic.jpg --> Is visible with edit<br />
<br />
You can even rename a file from .JPG to .jpg and it will work after it's been renamed.  Same for other image file types, BTW.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on this one?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

				<p>I'm not able to reproduce the problem on the current version, and I'm not seeing anything in the bug reports for past versions that would suggest the problem.<br />
<br />
Try your test on our demo server, and see if you can reproduce it there.<br />
<br />
You could also try installing a current version on your server and see if the problem persists. If not, then perhaps upgrade you current ATutor installation.</p>

				<p>I just reproduced the error in the ATutor demo.  In file storage there is a file titled "88888.JPG".  When you click "Edit", the image is not displayed.  <br />
<br />
Renaming it to "88888.jpg", the image is displayed when clicking "Edit".<br />

On a side note, I don't seem to get email notifications of a thread I've subscribed to on first reply.  It does work on subsequent replies though.</p>

				<p>I see now.<br />
<br />
I've posted a bug report. Will fix it when the next release cycle comes around, probably later March.</p>
