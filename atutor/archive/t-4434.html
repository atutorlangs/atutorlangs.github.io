				<p>Hi again,<br />
<br />
I would like to keep the menus closed by default.<br />
I've changed the default settings for the course but they do not apply when I connect as a simple user.<br />
My boss finds the interface very complicated and wants me to remove a lot of things, but the worse is that I do not manage to give access to my students to File Manager...<br />
<br />
can anyone help ?</p>

				<p>There is no file manager access for students in the current version (except read/write access for student with the file manager privilege enabled), though you could provide similar functionality using the ACollab addon.<br />
<br />
Depending on when you plan to launch your site, you may want to hold off until ATutor 1.5 comes out in June. The interface is greatly simplified, though the file manager is still not available to students. To do this would take some significant programming, which we could not describe here. You are welcome to attempt this on your own, or you could hire us or one on the providers on the services page to do it for you.</p>

				<p>OK.<br />
Unfortunately, I can't wait for the next version (I'll be on "pregnancy vacation" in June :p) because the job has to be done urgently. <br />
Can you tell me where I can enable "file manager privilege" for my students ? <br />

Thx :)</p>

				<p>OK I'va managed to do that.<br />
My students have access to the file manager and I created new links on index.php.<br />
<br />
Now what I need is to change those rights according to the status.<br />
<br />
For exemple I have a "Documents partags" folder which must be accessible to all and a "Documents confirms" folder where only the teacher can put files and modify them, and the students can only read them.<br />
<br />
How is that possible ?<br />
You told me about read/write access....</p>

            <div class="postheader"><h3>Remove Empty Menu's</h3></div>
				
			<div class="body">
				<p>Hello, I'm new to the forums and I have almost the exact same question as the original parent (and for the exact same reasons, oddly enough :P ).<br />
<br />
I am evaluating ATutor for a project I am working on, and I want to know how to completely remove certain menu's from the side (instead of keeping them closed). My boss also finds the interface very "overly complicated" and wants it to be simple, less cluttery and more accessible for students. It's really a valid complaint because many students struggle with computer interfaces to begin with.<br />
<br />
All we really want is the Global Menu (while in a course/lesson/module) and maybe the glossary, and the rest of it is not very useful or functional for our purposes. It's very noisy/busy with a bunch of "close this menu" and "none found" entries in our case.<br />
<br />
I have scoured the forums and the how-to lessons, but I could not find any information about how to customize these things a bit. All the themes I've tried still have the numerous empty menu's there.<br />
<br />
I log in as the instructor, and then change my personal preferences to what I would like the interface to show. Then I go to "tools", then to "course default preferences" and click "Save current settings as course default preferences" but the default theme always appears with the default options instead of the course default options. I would still like to change these things globally anyway.<br />
<br />
I am a mediocre php programmer and I'm not afraid to make changes to the code if I need to, but would like to be pointed in the right direction to accomplish this.<br />
<br />
I really like this CMS so and hope we end up using it for our project. Thanks for your time :)</p>

				<p>Removing the menus is more complicated than could be described in a forum message, though it is certaining possible. Indeed the interface is busy by default, but students can simplify it through preference setting.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you try the ATutor 1.5 beta. All the tools and menu modules are optional. You will be able to hide away the features you do not want to use. The final release of 1.5 is planned for some time in June.</p>

I know that the course settings are encoded into Table AT_courses, value "preferences", I've tried to force manually a value there, but as soon as I log with another account, the settings change !<br />
I've tried pasting the same settings into AT_members value "preferences" without success...<br />

Is it possible to have a definition of all these values :<br />
