				<p>I have just installed - a couple of times- 1.5.2  The instal went fine.  There were no error messages except the ones regarding the content file.  I set up an adminstrator and personal account with no problem.  The instal completed and indicated it was saved.  Unfortuneately, I can log in under my personal account but not the admin.  The ID/password error appears.  I contacted my hosting services and all the required support such as mySQL and php are supported and match the system requirements criteria<br />

Any suggestions?  www.projecttools.com/ATutor</p>

				<p>There should be no reason for a user account to work and an admin account not to work. Check the admins table in the database to make sure the account exists, and that you are typing the correct password.<br />
<br />
If it continues to be a problem, list the system information asked for when you post a message so we can troubleshoot.</p>

				<p>I have found that my hosting company is using 4.0.13 version of MySQL on their system.  That attached word file defines all the information available during the install proceedure.<br />
<br />
Can ATutor be used with this version?  What do I have to do to make it compatible?  I can look at the MySQL database and the admin info is there but it isn't being accessed by ATutor.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!</p>

It may be that that register_globals needs to be turned of in the php.ini file.<br />

Provide the rest of system information asked for. There was no attachement.</p>

				<p>Your mysql version is fine, and displaying "unknown" is normal, and we know about the problem with attachments. We're looking into it.<br />
<br />
Generate a phpinfo page:<br />
see:<br />
http://ca.php.net/manual/en/function.phpinfo.php<br />
<br />
Make sure register_globals and safe_mode are set to off.<br />
<br />
If they are turned on, do a search of the atutor.ca site for "php_flag" and create a .htaccess file as described in the search results.<br />
<br />
If that does not work, the only other choice is to move onto a server where the settings are turned off.</p>
