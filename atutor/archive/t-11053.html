				<p>Who's the owner? And what spam are you receiving? He's never told you could delete your account.<br />
<br />
If you're subscribed to forum threads, its up to you to unsubcribe if you don't want to receive replies any more.<br />
<br />
If you're on the announcements list, which sends out announcements of new released once every few months, then you just need to ask to be removed.</p>

				<p>Did you follow the link?  The only contact listed is admin@4screenwriters.com.  I don't know who that is.  All I know is that somebody using your software is spamming me.<br />
<br />
When I log on there it shows this as the tech support site.  I am trying to get off of the email list.  The first email he sent me said that I could delete my account by logging into his site.  There is no delete account button.  <br />
<br />
I have asked twice to be removed and for my account to be deleted.  So far no reply.  That's why I am here.  This is supposed to be the tech support link for that site.</p>

				<p>This doesn't have anything to do with ATutor. Beyond answering questions in this forum, we do not provide them with tech support, regardless of what they have told you.<br />
<br />
You will have to continue trying to contact them if you want to be removed from their mailing list. It's not something that's within our control.</p>
