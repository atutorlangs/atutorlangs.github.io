				<p>For what its worth, I have a copy of ATutor 1.4.1 running as a PostNuke  module on my baseline site at http://www.dnlt.com.<br />
<br />
I haven't populated it, as of this moment, but suffice it to say that it was a piece of cake, except for the sleuthing required to find the updated  pnATutor file that CAS had posted in the forums.<br />
<br />
The site is hosted via services provided by MidPhase in Chicago.   Before moving it to my "live" site, I prototyped it using VMware on my XP laptop with RedHat 9 and Apache 2.0.40.  I know the directions/suggestions don't recommend Apache 2.x, but I did NOT have any problems making it work.<br />
<br />
I have also added the ACollab in my VMware environment, and I may move that to the live site as well, although for the moment, I'm trying to figure out how to best use them in a semi-production environment.<br />
<br />
If you need assistance or want to trade ideas, please post and we'll pick up off-line or continue the threads here.   I would be VERY interested in assisting an organization that would like to use ATutor, et al in real life in the U.S.   <br />
<br />
I prefer to work for $$$ but if the story is good, I could be available for on-site consulting for the cost of travel and living expenses.<br />
<br />
This posting is based on Greg's encouragement to share the "out-of-the-box" experience.<br />
