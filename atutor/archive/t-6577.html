				<p>Hi<br />
<br />
Are you actually bothering to test the new versions of ATutor before you release them?  The 1.5.0 - 1.5.1 upgrade resulted in Admin accounts not being able to log in, and the 1.5.2 upgrade I just performed has left me with a blank page where the login screen is supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Now I'd understand this is you included the word "Alpha" or maybe even "Beta" with the release - But you claim that this is a full version.<br />
<br />
I hope you don't take offense to this - ATutor is a great piece of software - I just feel that if you're going to tell everyone "ATutor users should upgrade their current system with version 1.5.2." then it would be nice if 1.5.2 worked.</p>

				<p>That issue is probably very specific to your system and configuration. Since it's impossible for us to test every possible combination of system and configuration we count on the community to report issues with Nightly Builds, Beta, and Release Candidates.<br />
<br />
The beta and release candidates have been available for over a month in which time we requested feedback on any issues.<br />
<br />
A simple install of the last RC to report this issue could have helped us fix it, but with the lack of details you're giving us makes it a bit more difficult to reproduce. In fact, just with the details you gave us it would be impossible for us to reproduce.</p>
