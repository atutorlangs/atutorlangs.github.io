				<p>I have students in groups and when I create an assignment, they can successfully hand it in.  However, when they go to the File Storage Module and look at the Workspace for their group, they can download and even delete other students work.  It is like I have somehow assigned administrative rights to File Storage, though all student's  Account Status is listed as "Student"<br />
<br />
Privileges are all unchecked for each student.<br />
<br />
The documentation states, "Only instructors and assistants with Assignment privileges may access assignment folders. Students and groups will not be able to access any submitted files.", but this seems contrary to what I am experiencing.<br />
<br />
Any idea where I have went wrong? <br />
<br />
TIA,<br />

				<p>All members of the same group can access all files submitted to that group's file storage workspace.  Group workspaces are shared areas.  <br />

if you want to make files private, students need to upload files to "My Files".</p>
