				<p>I would like to upgrade my version of ATutor -- not worried about that. However, it says -- everywhere -- to copy the directory that ATutor is in. ATutor is actually installed in my root directory. Not sure how I can make a "copy" of my root directory. And I'm kind of scared to just "overwrite" the entire installation with the new version. I'm sure I'm not the only person with ATutor in the root directory of a site...<br />
<br />
Suggestions?</p>

				<p>Normally the web root is located as a subdirectory of the home directory for the user account, if you are on an ISP. <br />
<br />
How did you get the ATutor directory created when you unzip the distribution, to be you root directory?</p>

I own the domain "mattcoenen.com." I also own the domain "pedantesque.com". The latter is the website I run ATutor from (for my university classes). Pedantesque.com is an "add on" domain hosted on the same account "mattcoenen.com" hosted on. "Pedantesque" is a subdirectory of "mattcoenen.com" but it was created when the add-on domain was added. For all intents and purposes, the subdirectory "pedantesque" under "mattcoenen.com" is actually its own domain.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll just keep the version I'm running (1.6.1) as I have the gradebook "module" installed. And I have two classes designed. I don't want to chance losing anything.</p>
