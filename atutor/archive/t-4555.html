				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I would like to write a set of html pages and present them under the ATutor "Content" paradigm.<br />
<br />
The problem is that we need not only a hierarchical / sequential way of navigating between these pages, but ad-hoc links between the content pages.<br />
<br />
So, we would like to provide hyperlinks from the first page to the fifth etc.<br />
<br />
How can we link content pages from one to another? Is there any "permalink-like" way to reference a page? Please keep in mind that I also want to export the lesson as well for off-line viewing, so this referencing way must be portable (online/offline viewing)<br />
<br />
I could use the File Manager to upload these html files, but this option has the disadvantage of missing searching abilities in the content.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much,<br />

				<p>The Related Topics tool was created for this purpose. Manually  creating links within content pages is possible, though those links would break if you moved the content. The related topic links are maintained when you move backups, though a standard for creating related topics does not exist, so they will only work in ATutor.<br />
<br />
For interoperability purposes, links to other pages within your content should not be used, perhaps a flaw of the current standards. We recognize the need for such links, which lead us to create the Related Topics tool.</p>
