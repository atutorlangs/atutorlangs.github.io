				<p>Hi.  Ran across a new problem that I can't find info on.  When we import the ATutor_HowTo_1.4.3-Whole_course_ims.zip as well as the biz8.zip file we found.  Both will load, but no pics, java nor grahics can be seen.  We tried boosting file sizes to huge (>100MB) but still nothing.  <br />
<br />
Is there a php.ini file in production use that is posted we could compare against or use? <br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

5. The Web browser you are using to view ATutor, it's version number, and any default settings you may have changed.<br />

				<p>I tried importing into the atutor.ca demo site, and it seems to have imported ok, though the javascript is missing, which is normal since ATutor does not currently import information in the head of HTML documents (we're going to change this). All the images etc. are imported properly, and show up in the content.  <br />
<br />
There are some problems with the Flash. Inside ATutor or outside on their own, they do not play. It could be the way WebCT exports them. It could also be that required files for the Flash are missing, if they originally existed with the Flash, but are not explicitely referenced as a PARAM. <br />
<br />
If exported from ATutor, which builds the content package, rather than copying as WebCT, and some other systems do, the package will be missing resource files that are not explicitly referenced. Since Flash and other such content exists in  binary form, ATutor can not access the binary code to find the resource files referenced from within the Flash itself. This is a general issue with content packages that has not yet been addressed in the IMS specifications. Not all content packages will work in all systems unless resource files are explicitely referenced.<br />
<br />
With some minor editing though, I'm sure you could make your imported package function properly, and when exported after explicitly referencing resource files in the HTML PARAM element, the content will be fully interoperable with other systems.</p>

				<p>Dear Greg,<br />
<br />
My school has been receiving quieries from members of the ATutor community regarding the course "WebCT Migrate" on the ATutor 1.5 Demo Course Server.  I have looked at the course and noted that it is the Maths course I attached to a previous posting.<br />
<br />
While some course material is intended to be open-access and copyright free, this material is certainly not and is the property of Imperial College.  I should have made this clear when I attached the package to my posting.<br />
<br />
Please remove the course.<br />

			<div class="body">
				<p>I have been having a similar (maybe the same problem) with some webCT content that I have been bringing into ATutor.<br />
<br />
I have found that any javascript or shockwave reference to resources do not find the resources, even when the resources exist in the expected path.  There is javascript code to pop-up a window to shows a referenced image and there is a shockwave loader file that loades and playes a referenced shockwave file. In both cases the referenced resources exits (for example the referenced image file may be  "images/mypic.jpg", and sure enough in the course folder, there is an images folder containing mypic.jpg) , but in neither case do the referenced files get loaded.<br />
<br />
However, If I move the referenced folder into the ATutor folder then everything works as expected. This is not a good thing though. If I make the path in the javascript code absolute, the javascript works ok, but this is also not a good thing. <br />
<br />
Any ideas? <br />
