				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm just implementing the Atutor into a Joomla installation. But there is not only the normal login module in use, but the aec subscription manager. so I need to have the AEC Scripts to write simultaneously into two databases with registration or data updates of users. there is no problem wirth writing all "regular" data to the members table. <br />
But everytime I try to log in, it is said, that there is still confirmation of email necessary.<br />
I didn't get it how I could tell Atutor that there is no need to get a mail-confirmation.<br />
<br />
probably it's a problem due to the hashes that are generated for some tables, I don't know.<br />
<br />
Anyone knowing more of this?<br />
<br />
Thanx for your help!</p>
