				<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I am getting this error message on the first page after log in for administrator:<br />
<br />
You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ') and status like '%Installed'' at line 1<br />
<br />
Apart from this (which causes the system not to display the ATutor version and patches installed), everything seems to be fine. I don't see the error message when I log in as an instructor or a student.<br />
<br />
I have seen some people asking similar questions here but I couldn't find any answer. I don't even know where to go look for that %Installed. I will really appreciate if someone could advise me.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

Operating system ATutor is installed on - Kubuntu 8.10<br />

There's been no references to SQL errors by others that I recall. Connection to the patch server issues yes, but not SQL. <br />
<br />
Maybe the file was broken. Try replacing it with a fresh copy from the repository.<br />

				<p>Hi Greg,<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for the reply. Strangely, the error message went away and everything seems normal now, without me doing anything. Yesterday, I couldn't see patches and system's information. I think I even rebooted the PC.<br />
<br />
I compared the original index_admin file and the one on the server and didn't see any difference. Then, I tried logging in as an ATutor admin and the error message is gone. It must have been a glitch.</p>
