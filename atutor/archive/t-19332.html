				<p>ATutor Version:1.6.3. <br />
PHP Version:5.2.4-2ubuntu5.7<br />
MySQL Version:5.0.51a-3ubuntu5.4-log<br />
OS:Linux 2.6.24-25-xen<br />
<br />
Please help me, I have a serious problem that avoid me using Atutor with teachers and students! I pass last night on it without result.<br />
 <br />
I upload files (word document, pps document, images) into file storage and also into the course by using file manager when I authoring content pages.<br />
When I try to retrieve the content, the operation fails because the files are empties! I look into the directory "content" of Atutor (with a client FTP): there are the files and they are full! I also look for authorization, they seem ok, I set it (by client ftp) via chmod. <br />
What can I do? I hope in your help, thank you very much, ciao<br />

				<p>Mention this to your Internet provider, if this is something that started recently. It may be related to a recent PHP upgrade, or other changes to the server.<br />
<br />
To confirm, permission on the content/file_storage/ directory, and its sub directories, should be set to rwxr-xr-x (755) and owned by nobody:nobody (assuming that's your webserver user). Files themselves rw-r-r (644).<br />
<br />
This should all be setup automatic when the content directory gets created during installation. Something else may be going on if you have to reset permissions.</p>
