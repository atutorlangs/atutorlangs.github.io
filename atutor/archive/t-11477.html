				<p>Hi to all,<br />
<br />
I am a middle school teacher that would like to use ATutor in my classroom.  I would like to try out the software.  I have a pentium 4 1.8 laptop running the latest 6.0 Linspire/ubuntu operating system.  Is there a version of ATutor that will operate on this system?  Do I need to install something else?  Is it windows only?  If so, I have a HP AMD dual 64 laptop running Vista Ultimate.  Will it run on there if I find a way to install easy php or something like that?  I want to build a linux server in my classroom, but it could be Microsoft if that is what is required.  I have access to several old boxes I could build up, or I could just purchase the correct equipment.  I am in the last semester of a graduate program leading to a "Certificate in Online Teaching and Learning" at New Mexico State University.  This semester we are "putting up" our play like courses for others in the cohort to test...  If I can't get this or Moodle running I will have to fall back on the university's WebCT system.  I have access to that through my course, but it will not help me develop course for the future or help me drag the other faculty at my school kicking and screaming into the 20th century (I'll worry about the 21st century later).<br />
Thanks for any help,<br />

				<p>Hello Jim<br />
ATutor will run on any platform that has a Web server,  php and mysql installed. We generally recommend using Apache as your web server, though you can also use IIS on Windows systems. Theoretically ATutor should also run using other Webservers that support php. We use Linux for all of our ATutor servers,  which I would say is your best alternative for a production system.<br />
<br />
On windows and mac various packages are available (like XAMP and MAMP respectively) to install Apache, php, and mysql with a few mouse clicks. XAMP is also available for Linux, though we generally setup Linux ourselves by installing the pieces manually, using linux packages if available, which gives added control over the system. So there are lots of options for setting up the system to run ATutor. Once you have the websever and database running, installing ATutor is straight forward, unzipping it into the Web server's document root, then opening it in a browser and following the instructions.</p>
