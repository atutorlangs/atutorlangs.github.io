				<p>It's difficult to say what happened. <br />
<br />
Our local system works fine, and no others have report such a problem. The only thing that comes to mind is maybe the success redirect is pointing to the fail redirect, in the account setup.</p>

				<p>Looking closer, I'm guessing PayPal has changed its return data, again :-/ . The module looks in the returned GET data in the URL, and the value of the "st" valiable, successful if it returns Complete or Pending. <br />
<br />
We are in Release mode right now, so this is not something we can deal with for the time being. If you want to investigate yourself, look at the information returned in the URL when being redirected back to ATutor from PayPal, and look at the following file<br />
<br />
http://atutorsvn.atrc.utoronto.ca/repos/atutor/trunk/mods/ecomm/response_paypal_user.php<br />
<br />
Please tell us what you find, and we'll incorporate it into the next version of the module.</p>

				<p>Hi all,<br />

I am a new user but I am also receiving the same problem which is very confusing. <br />

Many thanks in advance.<br />
