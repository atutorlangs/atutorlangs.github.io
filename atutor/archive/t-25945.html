				<p>I have just installed the latest version of ATutor. I have unpacked it etc. I have created the correct directories and begun the installation process. The system check was successfully passed with no errors.<br />
<br />
I was asked to provide the database information. I provided that information then clicked next. This took me to "ATutor 2.2.2 Installation" of http://ljunction.com/ATutor/install/install.php. The header appeared and the rest of the page was completely white and the installation just stopped.<br />
<br />
How do I fix this problem? As far as I can tell, the diretory and file permissions are correct as is the database information. As far as I can tell, no database tables were created.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any help.</p>

				<p>OK... I solved this problem by uploading a nightly version file. I think that atutor expected the default database name but I was prevented by my system from providing this.<br />
