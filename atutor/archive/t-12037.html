				<p>I just installed ATutor on my new site "Learn Open Source" and it was easy as pie.  I'll have to do a video on it soon.<br />
<br />
The only time I had to leave the install was to create the mysql database and the content directory which I renamed to something more fitting for my site.<br />
<br />
Now I just have to write a mod for online video training to show my lessons.<br />
<br />
This is exciting.<br />
<br />
By the way, why aren't you guys included in the fantastico install for cpanel?  Moodle's in there.  I do think ATutor is better than moodle and I haven't even started digging through it yet.<br />

				<p>It'd be better if they heard this request coming from an ATutor user, rather than the developer. Others have also made the request. If they get enough of them, perhaps they'd add it to cpanel.</p>
