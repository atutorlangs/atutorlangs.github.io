				<p>I am trying to create logically separate instances of atutor (separate courses within an organization). Users within an organization should only see courses for that organization. I looked at ACollab but it appears to handle grouping within a course not courses within a group. My first thought was to dynamically set the DB_NAME in config.inc.php using a parameter passed when loading atutor and setting a session variable but once I'm logged into atutor the session variable is no longer available and the database reverts back to my default. Any ideas / thoughts / suggestions on what would be the best approach for this?</p>

				<p>What do you mean by logically separate. <br />
<br />
Could you rephrase your post. It's not clear what you are trying to accomplish.<br />
<br />
Have you read through the Administrators section of ATutor HowTo?<br />

				<p>I would like to be able to group students by company / entity and allow those students to view only the courses available for that company / entity. My thought is that I could create a separate database for each company / entity and change the config.inc.php to dynamically load the database name instead of the static default. I have looked at the Administrators section and ACollab and neither appeared to address a situation such as this. I tried to modify the config.inc.php to push the database name into a session variable but after the login it is no longer set. With you knowledge of the system, does my approach seem viable or would you approach this differently? <br />
Thank you very much for your response.</p>

				<p>I understand what you're trying to do, and an easy solution doesn't come to mind.<br />
<br />
If possible, I'd say just create two seperate installations of ATutor and ACollab, but then you would have two different member tables and would have to direct different members to a different installations/URL, which could be complicated. Not having ALL accounts in the same table could become a problem to your ogranization. Once ATutor has LDAP support then that wouldn't be an issue anymore, but that's not for some time yet.<br />
<br />
You could also make all the courses private and hidden, and only give access to the courses on a member by member basis (a lot more manual work assigning members to courses).<br />
<br />
You could also try using the Course Categories to group your courses, then adding a small peice of code that would depending on some session variable default to a different Category. (not sure which session variable you might use, you would have to add one, and possibly add a field in the database as well).<br />

			<div class="body">
				<p>At the university we are dealing with 1st to 4th year students with a total of some 7,000 students studying English in any given semester.<br />
<br />
We created five seperate installations of ATutor and ACollab, (ATutor and ACollab contain the master courses and are only used for development and change while ATutor 1 - 4 and ACollab 1 - 4) are used for each year groups' courses. <br />
<br />
The main Language Centre page has links for each year group which links to another page with their course links to ATutor. <br />
<br />
Incidentally there are quite a lot of courses in each semester - for example Year 1 students could be doing any of the three courses - Remedial English, English 1 or English 2. Yjere are 41 classes with about 30 students in each doing English 2 in Year 2 and the content in replicated from a backup of the master course to these 35 classes. <br />
<br />
This may seem comlex but it is not at all difficult. Only occassionally do students try to access a course that they are not enrolled in. Hope it makes sense.</p>

It sounds like you're using ATutor extensively. Perhaps if you give us more details and guest access to your installations we can work together to figure out a real solution, if you are in fact committed to using ATutor in your university environment.<br />
