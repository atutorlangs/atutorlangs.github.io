Is it possible to pass the tracking information from flash to atutor and atutor to flash?<br />
<br />
Is atutor is scorm compliant?<br />

It is possible to extrapolate from the tracking data how much time was spent on a test, but the testing tool itself does not track time taken. ATutor does not track bookmarks.<br />
<br />
Regarding flash data, we have not done any work with flash based data collection yet. The potential seems to be there. See the php.net site for info about php flash support.<br />

SCORM compliance, not yet. That will likely come in the next release, spring 2004. IMS content packing compliance has been added to V1.3, a subset of the SCORM specifications, making it possible to reuse or redistribute content created in ATutor.<br />
