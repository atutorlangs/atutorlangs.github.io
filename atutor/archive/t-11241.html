I've already using Atutor for the past few weeks and been using the email. But other users can't receive their email while others can. Like our proxy SMTP is "mail.ateneo.edu", all email within that reach can receive email like mcbtaroy@ateneo.edu, but anyone who had email like yahoo or gmail or any other email account they can't receive any email from ATutor. This is the maillogs:<br />

				<p>yahoo and gmail have aggressive spam filters. You will need to ask your users to check their spam filters, and approve mail from ATutor.</p>

				<p>I already tested one email, my yahoo account, but still it's not working. <br />
I've been using Mantis too it was installed where Atutor is, and it can send email to other email account(yahoo,google,etc).  <br />
Do i need to edit the include/classes/atutormailer.class.php or the class.phpmailer.php of ATutor?</p>

				<p>Assuming Sendmail is working on your Linux server, you should not need to do anything. I still think it has to do with the spam filters on the public email sites. Mantis may get through, but it does not mean ATutor mail can get through. Check the filters on these sites, and add mail from ATutor as trusted. <br />
<br />
Talk to your ISP if it continues to be a problem. If you have an email address from someplace other than these public sites, or know someone who does and would be willing to help with a test, try that.</p>
