				<p>Hi, I don't know if ATutor support this kind of scenario:<br />
<br />
Suppose that the courses are organized by levels. So a student can't subscribe to any course in the level II if the level I has not lapsed or if he/she lost the level. The point is that I will like to know if Atutor has this kind of "promotional" or "autopromotional" system that takes the courses by levels (as in the highschool or the university).<br />
<br />
Exist any way to make this kind of implementation in ATutor ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

				<p>Hi greg.<br />
<br />
I will like to contribute with this feature but I'm not an expert. I will love to make it hand by hand with the ATutors developer team to make it possible in the next releases.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to have a more personal contact with you ? can I write you a mail ? Maybe I will develop this feature and give it to you for testing and checking.<br />
<br />
You can write me a mail to alan.smithee@msn.com<br />
<br />
Thanks !</p>

				<p>You are welcome to give it a try. Be sure to read through the developer documentation before you start writing code. Most important, you need to be working with the trunk source code in our code repository. <br />
<br />
We would not take on a project like this ourselves without some funding to cover programmer time. And, we are pretty focused on other things right now, so it might not be something we can take on for a little while.</p>
