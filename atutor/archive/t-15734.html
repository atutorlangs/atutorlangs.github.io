				<p>I uploaded a list of participants for a course with a test email to myself. I received instructions to log in and my log in name, but it didn't give me a password?<br />
Do the participants who were added to the list need to create their own passwords after they have been enrolled into the course? Thanks.<br />

				<p>Hi Greg, there are two emails sent out, one with the log in and password, and the other, with just the log in.<br />
<br />
One says:<br />
A user account has been created for you at: <br />
It has the log in and password.<br />
<br />
And the other one: <br />
Your enrollment request for the course Online <br />
<br />
I just want to make sure that these are legitimate emails from Atutor? (Both of them have links to my atutor sute that when I click on, they take me to <br />
http://viewallclicks.com/soft.php?aid=0147&d=6&product=XPA&refer=bb1f0c2b3)<br />
<br />
My question now is, how do I edit the emails that get sent out so I can give instructions to copy and paste the url to my site, so they don't click on the link?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>
