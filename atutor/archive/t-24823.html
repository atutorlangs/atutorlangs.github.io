			<div class="body">
				<p>Hi.  I have 2.0 installed and I'm wondering where the "roles" are defined that are used in the AT_course_enrollment table.  <br />
<br />
I'm making a modification and I want to create a new role, but I don't want to break anything.  Is there a file where these live?  Or would it be ok to just manually type in a new role directly into the table?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

				<p>There are not custom roles per se, but rather permissions. In the enrollment manager you can select a member then click the Privileges button and assign access to specific tools in a course.<br />
<br />
There's a similar tool for admin, under User>Administrators, you can assign specific privileges on a user by user basis for admin tools.</p>

				<p>Right.  I know about permissions.... this would be something different though.<br />
<br />
Do you think it would break something if I manually entered a new "role" directly in the database?</p>

				<p>I'm not certain how you'd go about creating a role without some significant changes. Potentially the status field in the members table could have another value added. I believe it would be a little more involved than just adding a new status in the database.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if you describe what you're trying to accomplish, I could suggest something based on current functionality.</p>

				<p>Sure.  I do live online sessions via webconferencing and I've created a system to track attendance.  The live sessions are recorded, and some users have signed up to only view the recorded sessions instead of attending live.<br />
<br />
So, I have a simple table that displays all enrolled students.  In that table, I want to NOT show those users when I update attendance.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that a simple call to the database would be used here.  So, something like... <br />
<br />
[php]<br />
if($row['role'] == 'Student'){<br />
  echo '&lt;tr>&lt;td>display_name($row['role'])&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>';<br />
}<br />
[/php]<br />
<br />
and I would have recording only people's role be "recorded_only" in the database.<br />
<br />
What do you think?</p>

				<p>Sorry for the follow up post, but to clarify, I would just manually type in "recorded_only" or something like that for a particular user in the database.<br />
<br />
If that would break something or just isn't a good idea in general, I'll look at another route.  I have some other ideas in mind.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

				<p>It doesn't seem like there would be any ill side effect of doing what you suggest. If its self-contained in its own table, and there aren't any variables used that are already used elsewhere, you should be fine.</p>
