				<p>Hello.<br />
<br />
This is my first post here so go easy ;)<br />
<br />
Our company provides online training using aTutor. Recently we have run into a few errors (usually about permissions).<br />
<br />
Whenever we try to use the 'Chat' facility we get the following error (see below). By 'use' i mean just clicking on 'Chat'. We used to get an error when trying to create a new transcript/chat but I think that's fixed for now.<br />
<br />
The admins using the chat facility use both Firefox and Internet Explorer. <br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated as we have a chat session tonight but it's not the end of the world if it's not fixed, we have other methods of communication, it's just a hassle is all.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

				<p>On linux the system's root user can run the following commnd on the lab-content/chat/ directory.<br />
<br />
chmod a+rwx chat/<br />
<br />
There may also be a problem with the path to the content directory if is contains symbolic links. Create a file with the following lines in it, then open the file in your Web browser to display the actual path to your content directory. Then check the include/config.inc.php file to make sure the path to the content directory defined there matches the one generated by the file. If not, replace the path in the file with the generated one.<br />

				<p>Hello Greg<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help. You were right, the path to the lab content was wrong. In the config php file it was set to /lab-content/ but we just use /lab/<br />
<br />
I have also sent a message to our support asking if they can run the chmod command, hopefully thing will work smoothly after that. I'll report back soon no doubt :)<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

P.S - I would have replied to this thread sooner but I didn't receive an email saying you had replied. Maybe it was filtered to my junk mail, who knows!</p>

				<p>Woah woah aTutor did NOT like me changing that content url in the config file. I think it is correct because when I changed it to what the above php script told me, everything disappeared and there were errors everywhere. Had to change it back immediately and then everything was fine!<br />
<br />
Still waiting for support to get back to me though.<br />
