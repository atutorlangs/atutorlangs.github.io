				<p>I am working on my masters project, trying to work on LORs and LCMS in arabic. I downloaded Atutor and it worked fine, I downloaded the arabic language pack, it worked but there are some problems with the lenght of fields in the database (I can fix that...). The thing is, I registered with Atutor as an author and tried to create a course in arabic, but I kept getting question marks instead of characters and unicode character symbols instead of arabic letters. It seems to me there's a problem with the character codes... Is there a way I can fix this? or do you know of a way I can work with TILE properly in arabic. Is there any other LOR that I can use?<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

				<p>I am not aware of a LOR available in Arabic. If you do find one, please mention it here so others are aware. Depending on the LOR it may be possible to create a module to link it into ATutor like that done for the TILE and TLE repositories.<br />
<br />
Regarding the character set problems, the current language pack is published in WINDOWS-1256. You might try converting the language pack with the &lt;strong>UTF-8 conversion utility&lt;/strong> linked from the atutor.ca translation site. <br />

<br />
Before you import the converted pack into ATutor, delete the old one from your installation</p>
