				<p>I seem to have a problem with the numbering of sections within my courses.<br />
When I open [i]any[/i] course, the section number that appears in the main part of the screen is always 1 larger than the number that appear in the global or local menu (the one in the menus is the correct one).<br />
<br />
So, for example, when viewing the How To course, the first section "1 Welcome" will appear as "2 Welcome" in the main screen. The links at the top and bottom of that screen are also wrong.<br />
<br />
Any ideas which files I should be looking at to fix this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

				<p>I've been playing some more, and I think I've tied down exactly when this is happening.<br />
<br />
Create a course. Add some content pages. Now, if I try and add another course while the current course is open (ie the sidebar is visible), the above porblem occurs.<br />
<br />
If I try to add a course immediately after logging in, it works fine and doesn't do the above problem.<br />
<br />
Another problem I have found, is that when I add a new course it doesn't appear correctly on the "Browse Courses" list. An entry is there but the course title is missing. It appears after I go into the course properties and re-save them.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate it if someone could try the above on their system, to see if it is a problem with my set up.</p>

				<p>I've just done a test by copying a fresh set of php pages from the 1.4.2 zip file on this site. I thought it might have been something I'd messed with when I was changing the look of the pages, but it hasn't made any difference.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing, then, that it is either a problem with the current release, or a problem with my database (which was created by this release).</p>

Does my explanation above help with re-creating the problem?<br />
