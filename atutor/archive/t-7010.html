				<p>You should probably upgrade to the current version of ATutor, though you will need the recreate your theme. In the current version you can export themes and reuse them after upgrading. With 1.4.3 this isn't possible.<br />
<br />
In your case I'm guessing the user's preference setting is set to display the ATutor default theme. In the current version of ATutor you can set which theme displays by default, though students can still override that selection by choosing a different theme in the preference settings, unless you remove the other themes.</p>

				<p>Sorry about that previous post - a little quick on the submit there...<br />
<br />
<br />
We'll I would just delete the default template then, however my admin theme tools are all gone, they were there and now they aren't.<br />
<br />
Can I export my data from 1.4.3 and easily re-import it into the newer version?  I'll give it a go I guess!</p>

				<p>Like I said, "it isn't possible in 1.4.3".<br />
<br />
If the tools were there at one time, then it sounds like you downgraded from 1.5 to 1.4.3.<br />
<br />
Upgrade to 1.5.2, then recreate your theme for that version, after which you can export the theme and reuse it in future versions of ATutor.</p>
