				<p>1. The latest patch (for file storage) does not install. The page goes white.<br />

<br />
3. No emails come when students enroll for private courses. The box for that is checked.<br />
I am in enrollment season and none of my 200 students' enrollments has sent me a message yet. I have to run through all my classes enrollments to find them all, Several time a week. I still have several classes remaining to enroll. A total of 17, That's not fun. <br />
<br />
I am on godaddy where everything is pretty well up to date. Using the latest version.<br />

				<p>There's not much we can do to help. There would seem to be a whole range of issues on your server that are not reproducible elsewhere.<br />
<br />
I can only suggest you find a host that is known to support ATutor. SiteGround or ATutorspaces come to mind.</p>

				<p>thanks, Greg.<br />
<br />
The siteground referral is a good solution. Automatic installs and support there will, no doubt, make things easier for me. I will transfer my account when my godaddy account expires next year. Unfortunately, it is prepaid for this year.</p>
