				<p>Hi, my name is Marcos Navarro Buendia and I am a University student. At the moment I'm doing my Master of the Computer Engineering and the title of the Master is 'Assesment of e-learning platforms' and this is the reason why I need your help. I'm studing Atutor and the scalability of this platform and if I finish my Master successfully, University could begin an investigation projectand generate some work jobs. These are the because I need your help. Can tou answer the next questions, please?:<br />
1) How many users can be connected with your platform of Moodle (how many students and how many instructors)?; How many can be connected in the same time?<br />
2) What are the resources of the server: RAM, processor and operative system?<br />
3) Is the server using mysql, php and apache or other sw?. Is the platform scalable?<br />
4) Will your project of e-learning increase and  enlarge for more people?<br />
5) Did you develop the platform or it wasn't necessary? How much did the development cost?<br />
Excuse me because my english it isn't good and thank you for your help, I'm waiting your answers. Yours sincerely, Marcos Navarro Buendia.<br />
P.D:  If you don't have this information please give me the mail of the person who has it.<br />
Please, send me your answer to nabuen@alumni.uv.es and say me this answers and who are you (what's your company).</p>

				<p>1) How many users can be connected with your platform of Moodle (how many students and how many instructors)?; How many can be connected in the same time?<br />
><br />
I would expect you to be reviewing Moodle as well. But,... I assume you meant ATutor :-(<br />
<br />
Connections depend on the processing power of the hosting server, internet connection speed, traffic from other applications running on the server etc.<br />
><br />
A rough estimate with a 1 gig processor, and 256mb ram, 300 simulataneous connections. You\'d probably need 5000-10000 users on a system before this many connections might be reached.<br />
<br />
2) What are the resources of the server: RAM, processor and operative system?<br />
><br />
That depends on the traffic you need to accomodate. ATutor will run on a Pentium 100, with 8mb RAM, though it probably would not work very well for more than a handful of courses.<br />
<br />
3) Is the server using mysql, php and apache or other sw?. Is the platform scalable?<br />
><br />
Yes it used php/mysql/apache<br />
Depends what you mean by scalable. If you mean how many courses, that is only limited by the processing power of the hosting server. Technically there is no limit to the number of courses you can create with ATutor.<br />
<br />
 4) Will your project of e-learning increase and  enlarge for more people?<br />
><br />
Don\'t know what you mean<br />
<br />
5) Did you develop the platform or it wasn\'t necessary? How much did the development cost?<br />
><br />
We developed it from scratch. I\'ll say it was  expensive to develop (no dollar figures).<br />
<br />
Check atutor.ca over the next couple weeks for the release of ATutor 1.3.</p>
