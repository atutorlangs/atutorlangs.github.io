			<div class="body">
				<p>Upon attempting to install a language pack for Spanish, I receive the error message:<br />
<br />
Fatal error: Call to undefined function: xml_parser_create() in /var/www/html/ATutor/include/classes/Language/LanguageParser.class.php on line 32<br />
<br />
Things to describe: <br />
  I am using Mandrake 9.2 (updated)<br />
  ATutor version is the present version 1.4.2<br />
 php - ver. 4.3.3<br />
  mysql - ver. 4.0.15<br />
  Apache webserver ver. 2.0.47 (that was installed with my operating system but I did update it lately and wasn't sure about changing it to 1.3 though I would have like to do so.)<br />
 There have been no changes from the default setting of php, mysql, or Apache.<br />
I have used Firebird (updated) and IE6 <br />
I am hoping to get this solved because I would like to use ATutor to place courses on the Web in Spanish.<br />
Thanks for any help that you might be able to give me!</p>

				<p>Hi Greg<br />
<br />
I completely re-installed and began from the beginning in case there was something I did.  When I went to courses to change property-got the blank screen which made anything else I returned to click on blank<br />
<br />
<br />
I then used the courses file in the re-installion and made the changes on the appropriate lines as this file only went to line 53---that gave me a parse error  for line 21<br />
<br />
I then took the fresh file you sent yesterday and made the changes on line 114 to 116 copying from the forum.---same old blank screen again-----<br />
<br />
By the way I am using ATutor 1.4.3 and the web provider documentation to me says they are using Apache 1.3<br />
<br />
Since I am not a programmer this is the limit of my experimentation.<br />
<br />
Have I been the only one to have this bug.  <br />
This seems like a great program and a minor bug.<br />

<br />
It should have 149 lines. This fact suggests browser problems. Use a different browser when you are installing ATutor.<br />
<br />
[i]Since I am not a programmer this is the limit of my experimentation.[/i]<br />
<br />
You do not need to be a programmer. Experiment by example, using the surrounding code to guide you. You should know some basic HTML if you are intending on creating content, or at least know how to read it. Without it you'll be limited in the content you can create in ATutor. Knowing HTML will also help you understand what you're looking at when you are viewing and editing ATutor source code files.<br />
<br />
[i]Have I been the only one to have this bug.<br />

<br />
Yes this problem has been previously noted, and the solution suggested fixed it.<br />
<br />
Also note that you should stick to a single thread, so all related information about a problem is kept together.  In the future, start your own thread on a topic, or find another thread on the topic and continue posting to it.</p>

				<p>Hi Greg<br />
<br />
This admin problem is still not corrected.<br />
<br />
I reviewed all the messages we have been sending and in a earlier one you stated<br />
<br />
Message from: greg<br />
Subject:- Tracker specific<br />
Message: The problem only occurs when you change the tracker settings.  <br />
<br />
This is not only when the problem occurs.  It is anytime I change anything in course properties, i get a blank screen when I--- SUBMIT----<br />
<br />
I don't know if it is a SUBMIT problem but it is not only a tracker problem and it occurs with any changes in course properties as the administrator.  This is the only place this is occurring.<br />
<br />
Again it is not only a tracker problem<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
