				<p>i kept getting the collation error when i tried to install atutor 1.6:<br />
<br />
Database ..... is not in UTF8. Please set the database character set to UTF8 before continuing by using the following query: ALTER DATABASE `.....` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci<br />
<br />
i created a database and collated it to utf 8 general ci<br />
<br />
the reason was  that the installer attempted to create a new database even though i created one.<br />
I needed to rewrite (my host did as i have almost zilch knowledge of mysql) the install query in order for itt not to attempting to create a database<br />
<br />
After that the installation went smoothly.<br />
<br />
Maybe good to not that some hosing providers dont allow auto creation of databases.<br />
<br />
<br />
Things to describe: <br />
  operating system - win xp<br />
  version of ATutor -1.6 stable<br />
  versions of php -5.1.6<br />

				<p>Normally ATutor attempt to use an existing database if it exists, and is entered in step 2 of the installation. If it does not find one, it will attempt to create it.<br />
<br />
It may be your mysql user does not have table creation privileges. Are you able to confirm that it was indeed a database create problem, as opposed to a table create problem?</p>

				<p>We looked into it and that really seems to be the case. I had a made a database and filled it's name in the form (databasename) together with the other info required to make connection and begin the dropping of the tables.<br />
<br />
The install script still attempted to creatte a new database. I do have table creation privilege as i have often made and dropped tables into a database with the phpmyadmin tool.<br />
<br />
My host however does not allow an auto installer to create an own database (max nr of databases allowd for my acount is 2) A new database has to be manually created through the control panel (mysql tool).<br />
<br />
My host then followed the install and noticed that the installer still tried to create a database. He then managed to rewrite the install script in such a way that the installer did not try to create an own database anymore but that it used my database.<br />
<br />
After that the install went smoothly.<br />
<br />
Note. Many webhosts would allow clients to have databases created through an installer and these ppl would not encounter this issue.</p>
