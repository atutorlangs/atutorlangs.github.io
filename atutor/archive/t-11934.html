				<p>I've just upgraded to 1.5.5. and the platform is working but when you go to the student area, all the student tools are in the form of tabs that run the width of two screens and there are no icons. The centre of the page is blank. The server guys say there is nothing wrong with the installation. Any clues as to where the icons have gone?<br />
My server uses PHP 4.4.7 and MySql 4.1.22 version<br />
<br />
It uses h-sphere - server is hostdepartment.<br />
 <br />
Im using Firefox web browser.<br />
Thanks <br />

				<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
My apology for the late reply.  Have this problem been solved?  If not, what version did you upgrade it from?  <br />
<br />
It could be a theme problem.</p>

				<p>Thanks for the reply. The tech guys at the hosting site did a partial repair job - but it's not really right.<br />
<br />
They took the icons from Atutor 1.5.4 and used them in 1.5.5. but the tabs are still spread across two screen widths and I can only see the icons if I sign in with my  student id. If I sign in with my instructor ID there are still no icons in sight.<br />
<br />
According to them, they said that the site was trying to connect to the glossary. Not at all technical, but I can follow instructions, if you have any bright ideas.<br />
Thanks,<br />

				<p>Do you use personaliced icons?<br />
If that is the case, you have to upload the icons by FTP manualy.<br />
Foder:<br />
\images\courses<br />
<br />
If you use the same filenames as they have been in the previous version, it shoult runn without problems.</p>
