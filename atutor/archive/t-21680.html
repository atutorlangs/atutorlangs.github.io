				<p>Hi everybody,<br />
<br />
Let me first start off by saying I'm new to ATutor and am trying to help someone setup training courses for adult education. I've created a course for testing things out and within that course I've added a content page, which has a test linked to it. The person I'm helping posed the following question to me after I showed them the course page, "Is there any way to remove the link to the test from the Course Navigation menu?" Ideally they want students to go into the content page, read it, and then take a simple test confirming they read the material. There is already a link to the test at the bottom of the content page they could use. The link in the Content Navigation menu would allow a student to skip that entire process and just take the test (yes the test is simple enough they don't really have to read the material).<br />
<br />
I've done several searches on the ATutor website as well as Google, but have not been able to find an answer. I've also looked through all of the options on my ATutor website and come up empty. I'm not a web programmer or developer, but if someone can point me in the right direction I can probably find a solution. Editing a php file in the theme is not beyond my ability.<br />
<br />

				<p>There isn't a way to be absolutely sure a student has read content pages before a test becomes available. <br />
<br />
I'd suggest removing the test associated via the content editor, to remove it from the menu, then manually copy the link to a test, right clicking on the test's name in Tests & Surveys, then paste that link into the last content page of the section as part of the content.</p>

				<p>Hi greg,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your suggestion. I will talk to the person I'm working with and see what they think. Your right, if the student wanted they could go to the content page, jump to the bottom, and just click on the link to the test. At least with the test link removed from the content menu a student couldn't accidentally click on it without first seeing the content page.<br />
<br />
Also,I know the instructor just discovered the the prerequisite test function for content and was wanting to use it in their lesson. The thought process was a student would read the first content page and take the test before they could move on to the second content page. Any suggestions on how that could be implemented without linking the tests to content pages?</p>

				<p>Prerequisite have to be linked, or rather, associated with the page they are a prerequisite for. <br />
<br />
My suggestion is experiment with prerequisites for folders. Put each page in a folder.</p>
