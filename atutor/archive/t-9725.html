				<p>Hey folks:<br />
<br />
I've been losing my hair over this one and hopefully somebody can shed a little light on the problem.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to transfer existing web pages that were generated by Camtasia Studio to my server. My initial test didn't allow the Flash content to play so I decided to run a quick test to see if I could bring in a simple web page with a graphic in it. I did this by importing a quick and dirty file from Dreamweaver and by creating a file in the html editor. In booth cases, I have been unable to get the graphics to show up on the page. I have tried linking them directly to the page from the file manager, rewriting the links manually and still nothing.<br />
<br />
Is it possible I'm missing something in my installation? Is there a pathname that I need to address? The documentation makes it sound like a no brainer to link graphics but after 5+ hours beating in this I'm starting to lose enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
Any insight would be appreciated.<br />
<br />

				<p>The paths that point to flash file or image files in the HTML of your content page should be relative paths,  something like:<br />
<br />
<br />
[php]<br />
<br />
&lt;img src="images/start_register.jpg" border="1" alt="the ATutor registration form"  /><br />
<br />
[/php] <br />
<br />
Try importing a howto content package and see if the images appear. see the attached</p>
