				<p>I use an internet service provider Netfirms.com. All in all a solid company. <br />
<br />
but.... when I tried to install ATutor I needed to make changes to php.ini because it wouldn't pass the install requirements:<br />
file_uploads must be enabled (Required) Detected: Disabled<br />
<br />
also  upload_max_filesize and  post_max_size were 1/4 as large as they should be.<br />
<br />
my service provider won't allow changes to php.ini either by me or by them. <br />
<br />
Any Ideas? They have adminmyphp but it is very limited and you  don't have permission to access the adminmyphp directory.<br />
<br />
Can anyone recommend a commercial site provider that will allow me to run ATutor?</p>

<br />
toward bottom of page and also has consulting charges from ATutor team. I think very reasonable considering my pain. ;)<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that if you can't get cooperation for changing the php.ini your're just dead in the water.<br />
<br />
Any other thoughts on that last part let me know :)</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>In some cases you can include a .htaccess file that includes the settings that are not available in your ISP default php.ini settings.<br />
<br />
Not sure if you can do this with upload_max_filesize or post_max_size.  It's worth a try.<br />
<br />
<br />
Search to atutor.ca site for php_flag for more info, or visit the php documentation<br />
