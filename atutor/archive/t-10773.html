				<p>If you are asking for help, provide lots of detail so problems can be reproduced.<br />
<br />
Things to describe: <br />
  operating system - Linux (unknown distro)<br />
  version of ATutor - 1.5.4<br />
  versions of php - 5.2.0<br />
  version of mysq l - 5.0.27 standard<br />
  webserver & version - Apache 1.3.37<br />
  copies of error messages - None<br />
  changes to default settings -<br />
Inbox notification enabled<br />
Topic numbering enabled<br />
Content editor default set to HTML-Visual Editor<br />
  web browser being used - Firefox 2.0.0.4<br />
  and anything else relevant - Same problem experienced on IE<br />
<br />
I'm voluntary manager of an installation of the newest version of ATutor at http://www.aptt-elearning.org.uk<br />
<br />
Since installation to our remotely hosted server via FTP (which seems to have gone without a hitch) we have had the continuous problem of Instructors being unable to save the changed content in their pages. They will edit/add material, then click Save and Close - but none of the changes will be saved. There is no error message shown, but the Instructor will be dumped back to the Course List page (with the Content Navigation page still showing at the right).<br />
<br />
A related issue is that Instructors also can't change to the visual editor when editing content - again when the click the 'Switch to Visual Editor' button it again dumps them back to Course List page just as above).<br />
<br />
I've also noticed the same thing happening when creating a new course. The course will save if the Visual Editor is not used to create the course banner, but fails to save if it is.<br />
<br />
I've installed ATutor twice today, in each case removing the original files and databases, but with the same result in each case.<br />
<br />
Any suggested diagnosis? I've used ATutor in previous versions before and found it a friendly, resilient and powerful piece of software, so you can imagine I'm a little puzzled at the above.<br />
<br />
Thanks in anticipation!  BobG (in the UK)</p>

				<p>The problem doesn't seem to be with the visual editor, because you can try and enter HTML and it'll do the same thing. (I tested it in the File Storage area).<br />
<br />
So one of your installed Apache modules is not allowing HTML to be posted to the page, but I can't find any documentation on your installed modules. You'll have to get the server admins to take a look at it.</p>

				<p>Many thanks. I had a feeling it was their end that was the issue, but this seems to confirm matters. If there are more details to come I will get back to you after I consult with the hosting company.<br />
