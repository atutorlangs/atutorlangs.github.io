				<p>Hi,  My boolean word seaches on any of the forums pages were returning many hits from all over the atutor.ca site.   I eventually joted down the [i]view[/i] URLs for the forums of interest and added the Google domain search parameters to the search expression of:<br />
[i]site:www.atutor.ca/view/7[/i] for the Support forum<br />
[i]site:www.atutor.ca/view/3[/i] for the Bug Reports forum<br />
and so on......<br />
<br />
I'm new to the ATutor site forums and was wonder two things:<br />
1) Is there already a simpler way to set search scope  that I've just been missing?<br />
2) Is there a place where these sorts of tips about using the site itself are (or can be) located? <br />
<br />
Thanks and regards</p>

				<p>Greg,  Hope it was clear that I meant setting the search scope to a sub-branch (or sub-branches) of the atutor.ca site rather than outside of (beyond?) it.   <br />
<br />
The full-site search with refinement on results and google parameters is sufficient once you are familiar with the site.     As a newb, I was looking for a clean way to check the reported bugs before opening a new Bug Report thread.   Including the filter: [quote] site:www.atutor.ca/atutor/mantis/view.php OR site:www.atutor.ca/view/3 OR site:www.atutor.ca/development/bugs[/quote]   <br />
works, but is a bit cumbersome to recall or cut & paste when needed.     <br />
<br />
If you don't apply this filter for something like an eXe package related problem, you can't be certain that  reported bugs don't exist among the items below the top 20 that are returned - regardless of how you refine your boolean search phrase.   With the filter applied, "eXe" returns only 3 bug entries. <br />
<br />
Not urgent, but it would be helpful to have something like a "Search Bugs" link on the site that would simply append or apply this site filter so that the returned items would all be bug report related. <br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

				<p>You were clear.<br />
<br />
Maybe in the future this could a good addition. For now its just a simple google search for atutor.ca.</p>
