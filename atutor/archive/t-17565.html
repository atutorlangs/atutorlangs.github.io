I upgraded my Atutor 1.5.x to 1.6.2 everyhin is ok but I have problem while exporting a test. It says "Fatal error: Call to a member function getCharacterSet() on a non-object in ../include/classes/testQuestions.class.php on line 271"<br />
Does it occur beccause of the language. Because I have been editing the english lang pack as Turkish, because as far as I remember, 1.6.2 has no Turkish pack yet.<br />
By the way, I'll send the lang pack when I finisk converting the it into Turkish, completely<br />

				<p>You should download and install an old Turkish language pack, and add to it. You should not be replacing English with Turkish.<br />
<br />
Be sure you are working in a utf-8 environment when translating.</p>

				<p>Thanks, Greg.<br />
I uploaded 1.6.1 Turhish UTF-8 lang pack, and changed the line &lt;atutor-version>1.6.1&lt;/atutor-version> into &lt;atutor-version>1.6.2&lt;/atutor-version> <br />
in language.xml file. Now it works. but I have another problem. Some new modules which don't occurs in 1.6.1 keeps its enlish name in brackets while displaying.<br />
I tried to add lines and zipped it. While uploading the modified lang packs it says as belows<br />
<br />
    *  The language pack you are trying to import is not compatible with this version of ATutor. If you still want to import this language pack you must enable translating following the instructions at the bottom of this page.<br />
    * The language pack you are trying to import has not been marked as complete and published. To use incomplete language packs you must enable translating using the instructions at the bottom of this page.<br />
<br />
Without adding new lines no problems occur.<br />
What should I do?</p>
