				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I've read here there is an htmlarea integration, buy all I can see is a basic editor without any buttoms. This is not htmlarea I think... So, I have a problem or really there isn't such integration ?<br />
On this thread, there isn't an htmlarea integration, and this is very similiar what I found after install Atutor 1.4.1.<br />
<br />
And how can I do a total integration between ACollab and Atutor ? Because there is a directory inside Atutor named ACollab, but this isn't the ACollab1.1<br />
I think there is a integration at level of the database and installation directory, but I don't know how to do it.<br />
<br />
I wrote a post similar to this on the ACollab forum, and all the answer I got was "read the how to course". This is not a really great support, I think, since the How To is a very basic guide about how to use ATutor and ACollab, but not about how to integrate both of them.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</p>
