Only IMS cartridges or packages content can be imported directly into ATutor</p>

				<p>Well, thats interesting.  How to I log into the admin site of my Atutor installation.  Can't seem to find out where to install modules.  Anyway, I uploaded the admin course from the site and I can not see any content from that course as well.  I can see the navigation tree to the left but no content??<br />
<br />
Is there a separate login page for the admin?  Perhaps an admin directory in the installation directory root?  Is it different than the normal login...I thought it was.</p>

				<p>Admin login uses the same login screen as others, with the admin account information created when the system was installed.<br />
<br />
If you uploaded the admin package from atutor.ca and no content is showing up, then perhaps something is broken. You might try reinstalling.</p>

				<p>Thanks for your help Greg. There is an admin package? Separate from the install? If not when I log in with admin credentials created when installed ATutor where do I install modules at? Can't find it anywhere.  If you have to install an admin package after the install...why? Isn't it safe to assume someone who installs ATutor would want to administer the install specifically to install things like the SCORM module which truth be told I think should be include in a standard install..<br />

				<p>Admin tools are part of the system, not a special install. <br />
<br />
If you are logged in as the admin, you should see a "modules" tab. If not, then you are not logged in as admin, or you are a secondary admin that does not have module privileges.<br />
<br />
Did you install this ATutor system, or are you an instructor? Setup of the admin should have been pretty obvious during the install.<br />
<br />
The SCORM module is not ours, and it is not being maintained, so it will not be included with the core code. Now-a-days IMS common cartridge is the way to go. SCORM content is too restrictive for most purposes. It's available as an addon, for anyone who needs it. Our efforts though are focused on developing for the more flexible IMS common cartridge standard.</p>
