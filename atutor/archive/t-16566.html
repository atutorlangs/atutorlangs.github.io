				<p>Hello all. I have 1.6.2 installed and I have a question about the Gradebook. <br />
<br />
When you're not using a grade scale, but just want to display the raw score, is there a way to display the percentage in addition to the raw score?<br />
<br />
Or is there a way to define a gradescale that would display a percentage as well as a raw score? Or even just a percentage and no letter grade associated with it?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

				<p>Currently only one scale will display at a time. You can always have students see their raw scores by viewing their test results.</p>

				<p>Hi, I will like to have this topic live again.<br />
<br />
My question is how to not use a grade scale and just convert the percentage to a number?. For example, if the mark scale is from 0 to 5, 90% means 4.5 and 76% means 3.8<br />
<br />
How can I have this working ?<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
PS: I have ATutor 1.6.3</p>

				<p>Hi, right now the scores in gradebook are displayed either in raw score or a selected grade scale. The gradebook does not have feature to display in percent yet. But this feature has been added to our to-do list and will be evaluated before next release.</p>

				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
For ATutor tests, the scores are saved in AT_tests_results. When these scores are updated into gradebook at gradebook page "Update ATutor Marks", they are either updated in as raw score, or converted to a grade if the grade scale is selected. For external tests, the raw scores are saved only if no grade scale is selected for the test. Otherwise, the imported scores are converted and saved as a grade and the original scores are discarded.<br />
<br />
You don't have to disable the grade scales. As long as you don't select grade scale for your tests, they are not in use and harmless.<br />
<br />
Hope this would help.</p>
