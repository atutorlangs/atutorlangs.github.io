				<p>Hello<br />
<br />
I created several questions of both true:false and multiple choice.<br />
<br />
I added the questions to a course.<br />
<br />
I then took the course and the true:false questions were okay but the multiple choice questions said all answers were wrong in feedback.<br />
<br />
I checked the database table tests_questions and the true:false questions had answers as either 1 or 2 under answer 0. <br />
<br />
However the multiple choice questions had no answers in any of the columns.<br />
<br />
I then went back to edit the multiple question and again selected the correct answer and saved the question.<br />
<br />
But upon returning to the database discovered that there were still no answers for the multiple choice questions.<br />
<br />
Should question 0 be set to the number of the correct answer?<br />
<br />
Also why when I insert a new row into the database does it think there are two rows?<br />
<br />
Thank You in advance for your reply.<br />
<br />

				<p>Hi Greg<br />
<br />
What I did was manually enter a 1 in the correct answer position for the questions that did not have them (only two).<br />
<br />
Now the system is content to allow me to add more questions of all forms and there data is added correctly to the database.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what happened but it seems to have fixed it self.<br />
<br />
This also fixed the see more than three questions issue.<br />
<br />
How do I make a shrug emoticon LOL<br />
<br />
regards<br />

				<p>These things happen. <br />
<br />
Typically restart your browser, or try another if something does not seem to be working right.</p>

				<p>Hello there,<br />
ATutor question bank has a problem.<br />
Multiple choice questions correct answer prepared questions in type not checked. The correct answer might not be stored in the database.<br />
After the summer we press the question mark button, keep the right answer.<br />
Opened the Edit button, the correct answer does not come as a marked radio button.<br />
You can look at the pictures in the message attachment. When the exam is selected, showing all the questions marked wrong.<br />
Thank you for your help and support.<br />
