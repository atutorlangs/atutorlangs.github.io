				<p>I notice that the AT site has a googel serach engine in it. Is this the same as the tool used in the software?<br />
I am trying to find a way to do a site search which includes links, files and reading lists.<br />
I understand from some previous posting that at present the internal search engine only does text in the some of the pages. Is it possible to add another search engine, with more advanced features (e.g. google or similar) and would it find the data on these pages?<br />
<br />
It would be great to hear from anyone who has attempted to do something similar.<br />

Cheers,<br />

<br />
[green]It is the same as the google search module, but not the AT search itself. Google does not find content within ATutor courses (it can't login). Extending the search tool might be something we consider for a future release. Or a knowledgeable php programmer could probably do it sooner. <br />
<br />
Is there anything else besides links, files, and the reading list would you like to see searchable? [/green]</p>
