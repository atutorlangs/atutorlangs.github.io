				<p>I saw another thread talking about SORM but the basics are AICC for that matter. <br />
So is ATutor AICC compliant ?<br />
Is it planned to be ? <br />
As it was said it could be a nice feature as most of the courses dispatched now are using one or the other.<br />
could it be a nice replacement for a tool widely used as WBT Manager ?<br />
Thanks for any reply.<br />

				<p>We've built an IMS content packaging import/export utility for the upcoming release. AICC is not in our plans, though SCORM is, probably for a spring 2004 release (to include LOM, IMS Simple Sequencing, and IMS Test Interoperability).<br />
<br />
If you can provide an argument for including AICC support, that would provide significant utility over what IMS/SCORM offers, we'd like to hear it.</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>I' actually using a LMS like i told before ,which seems to be the most used here (may be i'm wrong) , and in my actual work we (where i work)   have planned to ask our courses providers (external societies) to make them build their courses using AICC only.<br />
Why ? Because AICC is used as a standard here more than scorm can be, even if it lacks some functionnalities, the goal is the same : to provide guidelines for courses deployment and retreive informations from the learner. And it succeeds quite well as i can see.<br />
Nevertheless, SCORM is the future, and you're right to plan being compliant with it. But please don't forget the main part of the others.<br />
Moreover, i think that making the Atutor compliant to AICC will be easy when SCORM will be implemented (basic rules are the same).<br />
Thanks & Regards</p>

				<p>Hello,<br />
I saw this thread and wanted to ask just out of curiosity....,<br />
Why did you choose SCORM over AICC?<br />
