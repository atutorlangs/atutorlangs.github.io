				<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Our group has been using WebCT Campus Edition Version 4.1, and we are trying to convert to ATutor.<br />
<br />
What I am doing is a two-step process: 1. export a course from WebCT(gives me a .zip file); and 2.import it to ATutor. <br />
<br />
This is an easy process and works just fine for some of the courses - but  not for all of them.<br />
<br />
For several courses I get the following problem:<br />
<br />
 After importing the .zip file to ATutor, I am opening the course page. It looks as expected - on the right there is a global menu, and on the left there are links to the corresponding chapters. <br />
BUT when I follow a link to any chapter, INSTEAD OF A CONTENT PAGE, I GET AN INDEX OF THE CORRESPONDING DIRECTORY.<br />
<br />
As I said above, it works fine for some courses, but does not work for some other courses. I am exporting/importing them using the exact same process...<br />
<br />
Did anyone else experience the same problem?<br />
<br />
What can I do to fix this?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
Inna</p>

We would be very interested in about your experiences migrating from WebCT to ATutor if you'd care to describe them here. I'm sure there are many others that would like to hear about your experiences as well.</p>

				<p>it actually sounds like the links you are using are links in the content themselves and not the Global Menu or the Local Menu links. is that correct?<br />
<br />
in which case the links you are using are trying to access the content package directory and the file that should be in it, but the file gets deleted when it is inserted into the ATutor database.<br />
<br />
ATutor does not yet handle links within content to other content pages. we are still thinking about possible solutions.</p>

Thanks for your reply! Yes, I am using Apache as my webserver. And yes, the DirectoryIndex has index.php and index.html, as you describe.<br />
<br />
So far it has been a pretty straightforward process to convert courses from WebCT to ATutor. In WebCT I go into ManageCourse, and then ExportCourse. This creates a .zip file.<br />
Then I create a new course in ATutor, and go to Tools -> Content Packaging, where I can import a content package. <br />
<br />
As I said in my earlier post, it works just fine for some of my courses. But for the other courses a content page contains just one link that takes me to the directory index... And I still do not know what's causing this...<br />

you could send us the content package you're trying to import and we'll take a look at it. or give us access to the webCT installation where we can try exporting one of your courses.</p>

Thanks for your reply!<br />
<br />
I AM NOT using links in the content itself. <br />
I AM using links in the Global Menu and the Local Menu. 	<br />
<br />
For some of the courses this works just fine - when I follow a link (within a Global Menu or a Local Menu), I get a page with the corresponding content.<br />
<br />
But for some other courses this does not work - i.e. when I follow a link (within a Global Menu or a Local Menu), I get a page with just one link in it. This link has the name of the content page again, and ... it takes me to the Directory index.... <br />
<br />
Any idea why this would be happening?<br />
