				<p>I am new to ATutor and it seems to be an excellent tool: relatively easy to use and fairly powerful. I have begun to create a new course, and wonder how much I can customize the look.<br />
<br />
I love how the home page has a list of icons for various modules, but the actual course itself seems marginalized by being on the right hand side. (My titles are long, and are cut off instead of wrapping which makes me unhappy). Once the user is actually using the content, I like that the sidebar is always accessible, and I realize that it breaks interface rules for it to be different on the home page, but I would like there to be at least a 'Content Page' with a Course Content icon on the home page since the user's eye is drawn to all the modules and can't find one that says "Course Content" or Start Here, or the Title of the Course. Is there a way to add an icon and to have it link to a course outline page?<br />
<br />
In terms of customization, I assume that ATutor has a css file somewhere? I want to customize the styles. Right now, I don't see any items under the format tab in 'Styled html' editor. I also find the text goes to the edge of the page and I want to change the padding. Can I do this?<br />
<br />
Is there a way to create sidebars/pull out text on a page?</p>

				<p>hi Kolel, <br />
<br />
you can customize the look and feel of Atutor a great deal. as of now the content menu can only be to the right, but that will probably be solved with a new theme. <br />
<br />
we use the "banner" part in manage -> properties to create additional content on the front page (for instance a big "start" button that links to the first content page / starts the course). you can use html and css in this box so you can do pretty much what you will. see attached screendump for an example (where the mpw logo and the text below is taken from the "banner" part). <br />
<br />
you find the css files in  /atutor/themes/default/<br />
<br />
you can do most with styles.css in that directory, but also have a look at forms.css<br />
<br />
not sure I understand what you mean by the sidebars / pull out text...</p>
