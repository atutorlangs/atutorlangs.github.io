				<p>If you are asking for help, provide lots of detail so problems can be reproduced.<br />
<br />
Things to describe: <br />
  operating system - Unix<br />
  version of ATutor - 1.5.2<br />
  versions of php - 4.3.9<br />
  version of mysql - 4.0.25<br />
  webserver & version - Unknown<br />
  copies of error messages - No error<br />
  changes to default settings - None<br />
  web browser being used - Internet Explorer<br />
  and anything else relevant -<br />
<br />
The e-mail confirmation is not working on my system. I get e-mail reminders of my password but if I subscribe I do not get an e-mail requesting confirmation.<br />
<br />
I had tried to upgrade my previous version but did a full new install and directed the wizard to my existing tables and courses.<br />
<br />
At this point I am willing to live with e-mail confirmation turned off. <br />
<br />
I only have two users I care to keep my admin user and a test student user. <br />
<br />
If I manually deleted these records and reentered them how do I:<br />
<br />
1. Set the admin user with the highest level of authority?<br />
<br />
2. Create a new user and verify their e-mail address manually in the MySQL table for users?<br />

Thanks,<br />

			<div class="body">
				<p>You have to turn on email confirmation in the admin System Preferences. I have confirmed in our local test systems that all email functions are working properly. They all use the same mail function, so its a mystery why only confirmation does not work. I can only guess that it has not been turned on.<br />
<br />
If you are going to install a fresh version of ATutor, you should start with a fresh database. Writing over an existing db will likely create problems.<br />
<br />
1. Create a new admin in the admin table. Set "privileges" to 1.<br />
<br />
2. Set "status" to 2 in the members table.</p>
