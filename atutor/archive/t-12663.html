				<p>We want the admin to approve the students but in Instructor->Manage->Enrollments->Course List it seems that the instructor can add anyone quite easily, bypassing admin. The password is set to the same as the id and these get sent. <br />
Is there an easy way to disable this feature from the instructors' interface? We'd like only admin to have final control (as in final approval)</p>

				<p>it's right that all instructors can add users to a course. in addition they can create courses and manage course properties. <br />
<br />
an alternative approach for you could be to use assistants instead of instructors, as assistants can be fine tuned more to what they have the privilege to do. for example you could deny them the enrollment privilege. <br />
<br />
a side effect would be that they can not create courses or edit course properties, so this would also have to be done by admin.</p>

				<p>What I wanted as for instructors to be allowed to create courses but not to enroll people. But thanks taking the time to reply. Appreciate it.</p>

				<p>I didn't understand whether you want to turn off the Enrollment tool for an instructor altogether, or just remove the Create Course List link.<br />
<br />
But anyway, I guess you could do that just like in http://www.atutor.ca/view/7/12639/1.html .<br />
You'll only need to find the appropriate assignments in the Enrollemnt module, and comment them out.</p>
