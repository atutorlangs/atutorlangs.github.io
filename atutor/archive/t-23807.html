				<p>Hello ,<br />
My name is David Israeli from the Jerusalem College of Technology - JCT in Israel. (http://jct.ac.il/eng/index.php)<br />
We are searching an Open Source E-Learning system for our need.<br />
I'll describe shortly the need, so we can discuss whether your platform is capable for this task.<br />
We have several student laboratories for the electronic engineering faculty, we want to make the entire course on some E-Learning system.<br />
In each session/class our students need to build an electrical circuit using the printed experiment material we give them, the experiment is divided by 3-7 steps, in each step they need to assemble the electrical circuit and check the voltage/freq./current/wave form in several location in the circuit, and write down the results in the final report.During the semester the student need to complete 8 experiments. The equipment in our labs come from Agilent Technologies (www.Agilent.com).<br />
<br />
<br />
We are looking for platform that can provide us <br />
Build the experiment on the e-learning system - The instruction and students can enter the tested values.<br />
For each tested values we want to display an image acquired from the Agilent technologies. We know how to acquire information from the Agilent equipment.<br />
Students cannot finish an experiment in one session, the system can save the experiment state.<br />
Generate reports from the students experiment<br />
The students are working in ONLY in pairs, so we need to have a custom login mechanism<br />
Students and staff management. We need to pair students.<br />
Under some circumstances the student need to get a staff clearance to proceed. for example - A student didn't come to the lab, his mate need to login alone. we want to see an special request in the teacher station whether to approve or not.<br />
<br />
Well that's the basic of it.<br />
Sorry for this long introduction.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
<br />

				<p>An LMS would not typically provide this type of interactivity, but if these experiments are run from a software package, there may be the possibility of integrating the software into the LMS. We'd need to know a little more about the software to know if that will be possible.<br />
<br />
What you are describing is probably going to need some custom development regardless of the LMS you choose. <br />
<br />
Regarding pairs, the ATutor groups features would provide what you need in this respect.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you try the demo to see what's available in the system, and think about how what currently exists in the system might be adapted to serve your purpose, and document what additional features might be needed. <br />
