				<p>Hello.  I was wondering if there was a way to release based on the completion of some previous content.  Or maybe releasing content only if a quiz is passed with a certain level of proficiency.  <br />
<br />
Is that currently possible with ATutor?<br />
<br />
Thank you!</p>

				<p>There isn't a way currently to set prerequisite content/tests in ATutor. <br />

You might find something like this in a SCORM 2004 player. We are looking for an open source player to make into a module for ATutor, if you find one you like.</p>

Not sure if this is what you're looking for, but there's another opensource LMS that uses SCORM 2004: http://ilias.bazaar.org/<br />
<br />
I really don't know anything about SCORM, but maybe in looking at their source code, ATutor could implement SCORM 2004?<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.</p>

				<p>thx, we'll have a look at their code. <br />
<br />
Its a big job though, and an expensive one. In my opinion SCORM is over rated. There's been lot of hype, but limited adoption. If there were a funder, we'd add it, but otherwise there isn't enough demand for us to take on the expense.<br />
<br />
The more useful standards we are implementing are the IMS Content Packaging, Test Question Interoperability, AccessForAll, and Common Cartridge standards.</p>
