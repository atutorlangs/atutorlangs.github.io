				<p>After successfully creating "original courseware" with ATutor 1.4.1 on a commercial/hosted environment, I used the "Export Content" and successfully created a ZIPped version on my local machine.<br />
<br />
If I create a new, but empty course on the host and try to use the ZIPed file on my local machine as the source to insert, it TRIES to run, but eventually times out.<br />
<br />
However, if I try the same process to a "prototype" environment that is basically local, the inserts happen so quickly that I barely notice the pop-up window indicating progress.<br />
<br />
At first, I thought it might be caused by mixed permissions/ownership issues, since on my hosted environment, MOST of the files are owned by my login account which is an ordinary user.  In the hosted environment, the Apache web-server is apparently running as UID/GID nobody/nobody.<br />
<br />
However, when I consider my prototype environment, I have a similar condition with regard to permissions/ownership, although it is not exactly the same.  My prototype system has Apache running under UID/GID "apache" and my baseline ATutor files/folders are assigned to UID/GID nobody or root.<br />
<br />
So my "problem" may have something to do with permissions and owneship on the hosted system, but it seems like it could just be a "timing" problem.<br />
<br />
Obviously I can't change the PHP timeout features for the hosted system, but it seems like they could be ammended within ATutor.<br />
<br />
I've browsed the forum(s), but haven't detected where anyone indicated they're using ATutor in a hosted environment such as mine, so that may be why this problem hasn't done its "Phoenix Act" yet! :) <br />
<br />
Any thoughts/ideas on a work-around or fix will be greatly appreciated.<br />

				<p>Something seems to be fundamentally wrong with my test environment of ATutor 1.4.1 running on Linux.<br />
<br />
I'm able to create a course and import SOME but not all of the default ATutor "How-To" courseware.<br />
<br />
Successfully imported:<br />
-Getting Started<br />
-Administrators<br />
-Accessible Authoring <br />
-Learners<br />
-Navigation<br />
<br />
But THESE fail to import:<br />
- Full course<br />
- Instructors<br />
<br />
It's hard to imagine why apparently pristine data from the ATutor site won't just get sucked up into a "stock installation".<br />
<br />
I can change anything on my prototype site, but its not clear WHAT to change.  Please let me know if you can fill in the blank spot(s) for met<br />

TIA.<br />

				<p>Check your php.ini file to ensure that both<br />
[b]post_max_size[/b] and [b]upload_max_filesize[/b] are large enough (over 2MB). if they are not then that would be the problem and you would have to change it.<br />
<br />
You can view that information by creating a phpinfo page:<br />
&lt;?php<br />
phpinfo();<br />
?><br />
<br />
to see what the value of those settings are.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the script may be taking too long to process. Both [b]max_execution_time[/b] and [b]max_input_time[/b] should be set large enough if the server is busy or slow and if your internet connection to the server is slow.</p>

				<p>Increasing the values for max_execution_time and upload_max_filesize seems to have fixed the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Joel.<br />
<br />
On the hosted environmnet, I used an .htaccess file in the root directory of ATutor.   The hosting company had set everything to defaults, so max_input_time was set to -1 which I think means "no limit" and the post_max_size was set to 55M, so I didn't fool with that.<br />
<br />
The max_execution_time default is 30 seconds.  I reset to 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
The upload_max_filesize was 2M, so I reset mine to be 100M.<br />
<br />
The default ATutor course uploads just fine now.<br />
<br />
The actual .htaccess file looks something like this:<br />
<br />
#### my ATutor .htaccess -- 08/11/2004<br />
php_value upload_max_filesize 100M<br />
php_value max_execution_time 600<br />
#### end of ATutor .htaccess file<br />
<br />
Some documentation might suggest enclosing the values in double quotes.  I don't think it matters, but I generally try to use the most universalist structures whenever possible.  Your mileage may vary depending on the configuration of Apache or possibly the operating system.<br />
<br />
Post a question or comment if you're confused or can't resolve your own problems on this subject.<br />

				<p>100M might be overkill.<br />
<br />
Another thing you could have tried was importing the content packages from the ATutor site using a URL instead of downloading the packages locally then uploading them.<br />
<br />
The ability to import content packages via URL is a very useful feature and is one of the ways to get around the max upload file size limit in PHP.</p>
