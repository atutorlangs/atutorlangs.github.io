				<p>Currently I am using:<br />
<br />
ATutor:<br />
    2.0.2(r10589 - 2010-12-21 16:47:09).<br />
Versin de PHP:<br />
    5.3.3-7+squeeze3<br />
Versin de MySQL:<br />
    5.1.49-3<br />
OS:<br />
    Linux 2.6.32-5-686<br />
<br />
For a bilingual course that I am preparing, I need to find out the way to allow the students to choose whether they want to follow the course in English or in Spanish, hence, presenting the corresponding pages.<br />
As far as I was able to find, the ATutor engine selects the language to use for the presentation of menu and messages, but I am not able to find 'how to' for the course language independently.<br />
<br />
Any idea will be much appreciated. Thanks.</p>

				<p>There is not currently a feature that would allow you to change the language of the content. You would either need to create a copy of the course, and present two different courses, or create duplicates of each page. in each language, within one course, and provide access to to both languages for all students.<br />
<br />
If you have a developer who knows some php, a feature like this would not be too difficult to create.</p>
