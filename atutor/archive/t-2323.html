				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm new to ATutor and presently testing the product. Appears to be a fabulous product.  I was wondering if the following feature was available:<br />
<br />
CASE SCENARIO: I would like that questions of my test to be inserted throuought my course, one question at at time in a definite order since the questions are related to the course.  My test has an average of 20 questions.<br />
<br />
WHAT'S AVAILABLE: I know that spitting my test into 20 different tests (one question each) and inserting a link to the appropriate test within my course content would not be very far from what I want. However, for statistical purposes I would prefer to keep my 20 questions in one test.  Furthermore, I don't think I can insert my test through SSI, so users could very well bypass the manually inserted tests...<br />
<br />
QUESTION: I would be satisfied if I could insert a specific question of my test at a particular place in my course using SSI, so the process is transparent to the user.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate any suggestions.  Should the developping team have workarounds for this, my client might autorize me to get support from you guys (Actually I'm still testing the product and will recommend it to my clients if this option is available).<br />
<br />
I thank the community in advance for his support.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Seb</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>What you've described, creating 20 tests and linking each into a page, is how you might create followup questions after a content unit. There's no way currently to create a single test, and split the questions among pages. This might be a nice feature though....<br />
<br />
There is need for more flexibility on the ATutor testing tools. This could be something you, or your client supports for future development, if such a feature would make ATutor more suitable for your circumstances.</p>

				<p>Thank you Greg.  Do you see any easy way to include the tests through SSI (using either html or php) So that the users can't bypass them ?<br />

				<p>It can be done, though not easily with ATutor as it currently exists. Not sure why you would want to use SSI. PHP would definately be a better way to go. You would need to develop the code.<br />
<br />
This is something that we plan on introducing when we add SCORM RTE support, though that will be some time away. I'm guessing late this year.</p>
