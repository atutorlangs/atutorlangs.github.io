Hello!<br />
I have been using Atutor for several courses in which I have included a lot of videos and Mp3. At the end of the last year I made a backup copy as I was starting a new school year.  <br />
However, when I unzipped the backup courses, I could not find any videos, mp3 nor the user name and e-mails of the students that had done the course.<br />
Please I would greatly appreciate if you could explain to me , if the files which I have mentioned above can be found in the server that I host ATutor software in a particular folder or if those kind of files are not included in the backup. Is there is any way I could upload them via FTP in a new course or I have to upload them one by one.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Susan <br />
<br />
 <br />

				<p>Did you embed the video and mp3 in the content? Or store in file manager? Or file storage?<br />
<br />
With the first two approaches, the video and mp3 would be saved into the backup zip, but not the last approach.</p>

				<p>Hi there!<br />
Thanks for your answer!<br />
Unfortunately for what you wrote,I am in trouble, as I uploaded them into the file storage.<br />
So next time I would have to upload them into the file manager and give a url address?<br />
<br />
Once again , thanks<br />

				<p>* How to upload files into file manager:<br />
<br />
Login as instructor -> "Manage" tab -> "File Manager" link, where you can upload a file, create a new file via ATutor interface, or create folders for organization.<br />
<br />
* How to embed video or mp3 into content:<br />
<br />
At pages "create content" or "edit content" -> access "file manager" link (version in or below 1.6.3) or icon (in version 1.6.4+) -> find the file you wanna embed -> click "insert" button besides the file.<br />
<br />
BTW, the forums is the usual means that ATutor users ask questions because the Q & A would benefit the whole community.<br />
<br />
The bounce-back of the emails to info@atutor might because of our recent office move. We will check on that.</p>

				<p>You might have known that students' names and emails can be found at "manage" tab -> "enrolment" link. But enrolment is not included in the backup. The backup is more for keeping the information that can be shared across courses, for instance, banner, content, assignments, tests, files managed and used by the course instructor, etc. The course-specific info like enrolment is not included.<br />
<br />
Moreover, the super admin account is created in the process of ATutor installation.</p>

As regards the administrator to enlarge the file, limit, I thought that it was besides the Admin that I have.<br />
