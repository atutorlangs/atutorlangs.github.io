Check the value of upload_max_filesize in php.ini to be sure that value is not set too small. By default this setting is 2mb, which may be a little small for some ATutor courses. We generally set ours to 8mb so large courses can be moved around without any trouble.<br />

PD: I found this link http://www.phpbuilder.com/mail/php-general/2002122/0942.php that may interest you.  It suggests a work around to the upload_max_filesize. I dont\'know PHP, so i don\'t if this will work, less how to use it:)</p>

				<p>You should have no trouble importing ATutor HowTo. It is less than 2mb.  You can not FTP the file to the server because it must be extracted by ATutor during the upload, and its parts put in the right place.<br />
<br />
You can FTP files into a course content directory if your ISP allows this (assuming you own the directory ATutor is installed in). This might be for uploading large files like video or content  archives. Talk to your ISP if you need help with FTP.<br />
<br />
Can you upload files using the FileManger? If not are the permissions on the content/ directory set to writeable?<br />

			<div class="body">
				<p>The problem is that the "max_quota" and "max_file_size" parameters are stored in the SQL database under the table "courses". When you create a new course, these values are taken from the config.inc.php. However, if you change the config file it does not affect already defined courses!!!!<br />
<br />
If it is empty course, then just remove it and create new and the new limits will be applied. <br />
<br />
If it is not an empty course, then use SQL queries directly to fix the problem.<br />
<br />
The easiest way for non-experienced SQL users is to have the MySQL Control Center installed on your workstation (downloadable from www.mysql.com). Then you can easily do such direct database editing from a nice GUI.</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>Unless you have purposely set "max_quota" and "max_file_size" to something smaller than the default values, this should not affect importing HowTo. Howto's size is smaller than the default allowable import size.<br />
<br />
You can change these values in ATutor by adjusting course properties with the administrator tools. You should not need a GUI front end for MySQL to do it.<br />
<br />
The values in config.inc.php are default values used if they have not been set on a per course basis by the administrator.</p>

            <div class="postheader"><h3>Import still does not work</h3></div>
				
			<div class="body">
				<p>This import function must have some hidden little secret...<br />
<br />
I have a fresh installation of ATutor 1.2.2. I first tried the File Manager and it worked fine, so my access rights are OK. Then I created a new course. I created a test page and then tried to import the HowTo course. It was really strange since first it acknowledged that the upload was done and the extraction was done. The wait window was closed automatically after a few minutes, but the page of the import.php remained blank. When I checked the file system I saw that the import subdirectory was properly created, but nothing was inserted in the SQL database. Also the external files were moved into the final content subdirectory, just the csv files were not parsed into SQL.<br />
<br />
The SQL installation otherwise works perfectly, other ATutor functions have no problem with creating new entries in the SQL database.<br />
<br />
When I deleted this course, interestingly enough the import subdirectory was not removed.<br />
<br />
I recreated the course again, but now without adding any pages manually. I started the import and the uploading went into an inifinite loop. I have no idea what it tried to upload for more than 2 hours, but it continously accesses my client hard disk and transfers something to the server. The files are not broken, they are in good shape, so the import.php must have some serious problem...<br />
<br />
I checked from another session, that in this case even the import subdirectory is not created. I really have no idea why it was done the first time, and why not a second time...<br />
<br />
As soon as the upload starts the import.php page will just show an error message "Cannot find server". But this is not true since in another window I can be connected to the same server from the same client both by SSH and HTTP.<br />
<br />
So please let someone finally tell us, what is the trouble with this import.php??? Or give us some pointers how to troubleshoot this module...<br />
<br />
Any help is welcome...<br />

			<div class="body">
				<p>I have carefully studied the differences between my two attempts of importing. I have found that if I turn on the proxy cache usage, then import.php falls in this infinite loop of uploading. If I turn off using a proxy cache in my browser, then the upload is successful in creating the import directory, extracting the content, moving the external files to final location, etc. However, the csv files are still not parsed into the SQL database, so the course is still not available!<br />
<br />
It would be really nice to have the option to this import process in two steps: 1./ upload/extract, 2./ insert into SQL database.<br />
<br />
It would be also nice to have more messages about the status of this process, so at least I could see easier what is the problem.<br />
<br />
The upload waiting window does not give any info about the percentage of completion. In some future versions it would be nice to see more info about upload speed and completion status...<br />
<br />
I am still waiting for some explanation for the SQL insertion problem.<br />

Try removing a couple zeros from line 145 in users/import.php from 10000000 to 100000<br />

If that does not work we\'ll need access to the shell to do further investigation.<br />

Try removing a couple zeros from line 145 in users/import.php from 10000000 to 100000<br />

If that does not work we\'ll need access to the shell to do further investigation.<br />
Put the phpinfo page back...<br />
