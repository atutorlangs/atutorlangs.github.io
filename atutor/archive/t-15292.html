				<p>I am experiencing a weird problem. When trying to add more quiz questions to the question database, they are not being added.  I am not receiving any error message (nor confirmation message), yet I can add other types of content (entries) to the db (i.e new courses, new course announcements, etc.).  I have checked with the hosting company, and there is still plenty of room in the db, and the db itself has no actual errors (verified via myPhp "repair" function).<br />

				<p>The version you're using is a little too old for us to investigate. We only have 1.6 versions of ATutor running currently. We don't login to systems anymore without a service package of some sort. Tickets are available for purchase if you need us to login and investigate.<br />
<br />
First thing I would suggest is getting the system upgraded. I would imagine what ever issue you are experiencing has been addressed in newer versions.<br />
<br />
You may want to ask your ISP if something has changed. Problems commonly arise when servers are upgraded, and settings inadvertently change.</p>
