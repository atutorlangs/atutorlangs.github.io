				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
My team and I have downloaded and customized ATutor Version 1.5.3 into two separate systems. One is for our company to host our own e-learning courses. The system is not meant to be distributed and is used mainly for us to deliver the courses. Another one has been customized for our potential client. It will be delivered to them, along with the source codes. However, we will not charge them for the system, but we will charge the courses we have developed for them and will be packaged together with the LMS. I understand that if we have customized ATutor (the base codes of the system) and plan to distribute it, we have to make to source codes available to public (except for new Modules that we have developed). The question is how do we do so? And how do we submit the modified codes to you? Thanks.</p>

				<p>You can just make a copy of your modified version available for download from some location. Or, attach it here. <br />
<br />
Or, if you are planning to continue modification, we could potentially grant access to our SVN repository where you can submit and maintain your code. See the developer documentation regarding setting up an SVN development environment.</p>
