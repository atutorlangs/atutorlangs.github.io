				<p>Several of you had trouble getting the language to load in a fresh ATutor install. We never figured out for sure what was causing the problem, but we did manage to fix it with a few minor code edits. <br />
<br />
If you had trouble with the default language loading after you installed ATutor for the first time, then you want to replace V1.2 with V1.2.1. If you didn't have any trouble, then you don't need to update.<br />
<br />
Download the V1.2.1 update from the Sourceforge site<br />
<br />
If you are upgrading from version 1.2 to 1.2.1 then follow steps 1 to 6 in the upgrade instructions. You won't need to update the database, step 7,  if you already have V1.2 installed.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, choose the instructions that apply to you.<br />
