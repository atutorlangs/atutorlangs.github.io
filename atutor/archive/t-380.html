				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I am planning to build a free internet educational site.  Atutor is one of the options considered.  It is important to have the following feature:<br />
<br />
Students have to pass a test at the end of one section to be given access to the following section.<br />
<br />
This feature allows the students to cover the course at their own pace while at the same time it ensures that they have grasped the material presented.<br />
<br />
Is this possible to do with atutor?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

				<p>This something we will introduce when (or if) we add SCORM support. Probably not anytime soon, unless someone were to hire us to add this functionality.<br />
<br />
I know you won't find this functionality in any of the open source LCMS currently available. It is available in a number of the commercial products, if you are willing to pay for it.<br />
<br />
Good luck in your search.<br />
