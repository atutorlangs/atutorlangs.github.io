				<p>Hi I'm using Atutor 1.64 and everything is running very smooth. However I have a few questions about the paypal module.<br />
<br />
1. When a customer tries to make a payment the Item description on the Paypal screen is blank as in empty how do I prepopulate that with the course description? Screencap attached (I have removed my email ID from this image)<br />
<br />
2.Vendor ID assigned by credit card payment service (Is this my paypal primary email address?)<br />
3.Password assigned by credit card payment service (Is this my paypal password?)<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help</p>

				<p>I have been working on this for some 42hrs now and still cannot get the course name / product to show when directed to paypal.<br />
<br />
I had my site working fine apart from pdtfk, so I switched hosts as well and started a new site with new URL. I installed ATutor using same database names, user names etc<br />
Imported mysql databases to the new install<br />
Copied my content over.<br />
<br />
I noticed yesterday that under modules it shows Payment module as enabled but not installed. The modules manager would not allow me to uninstall it so I deleted it. I was then able to reinstall the payment module using the module manager, however it still shows not installed but allowed me to enable it. It just doesnt look very professional when a client tries to make a payment via paypal where the item description is blank.<br />
<br />
Has anyone had similar issues or any ideas, I have delayed the website launch until I can resolve this.<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

				<p>I'm not sure how it could be possible to enable a module that has not been installed. You can only enable from the installed modules screen (the module manager main screen).<br />
<br />
We're continually having to tweak the PayPal code in the module as they change things regularly. Unfortunately we don't have the resources to resolve this now. As much as we'd like to support PayPal, its been something we've providing without funds to maintain it, generating a loss for us (while generating revenues for those who use it). Until we find a group willing to support PayPal development, we probably will not continue to support it ourselves. <br />
<br />
I suggest you try MiraPay, which has remained stable for many years (It's the service we use).<br />
<br />
Or, I would encourage you to try to track down the problem yourself, and if you resolve it, send the resolution on to us to add to the module for future versions.</p>
