				<p>I just upgraded from ATutor 1.6.4 to ATutor 2.0.1.<br />
<br />
When the upgrade was completed, the new site came up (still) with the 1.6 theme. When I go into Theme manager, it shows that ATutor (the one at the top of the list) is the default. I would think it would be the latest standard theme for 2.0, but it is definitely not.<br />
<br />
I've tried everything I can think of but I can't seem to figure out how to rectify this.  I want to go to the latest theme for 2.0. Looking on atutor.ca, I do not see this theme as a choice to be selected and downloaded.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
<br />
Things to describe: <br />
  Operating system ATutor is installed on - Linux<br />
  ATutor version - 2.0.1 (was 1.6.4 before upgrade)<br />
  Patch #s applied - none<br />
  ATutor theme name - ATutor<br />
  PHP version - 5<br />
  MySQL version - 5<br />
  Webserver & version - Apache<br />
  Copies of error messages -<br />
  Changes to default settings -<br />
  Web browser being used - Firefox<br />
  ...and anything else relevant -</p>

				<p>I'd guess you have a cached copy of the old theme overirding the new theme. Hard reload your browser, or dump its cache.</p>
