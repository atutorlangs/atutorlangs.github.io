				<p>Hi all!<br />
<br />
i'm migrating from moodle to atutor, now in testing phase to accomodate over 300 students. i understand that Course Files have default limit of 100mb, what about MyFiles?<br />
<br />
how could i manage the uploading of MyFiles by students, as access only by users. can admin or instructor delete the files in MyFiles, unlike moodle the Teacher can actually delete the submission or any file uploaded to the system.<br />
<br />
how do i limit the size of MyFiles?<br />
 <br />
thanks.</p>

				<p>Upload size and upload total are controlled by the same setting that controls the size and amount of files that an instructor can upload into a course, set by an admin on a course by course basis. Upload size is also controlled by the system's php.ini setting upload_max_filesize.<br />
<br />
There isn't currently a way for instructors to delete files uploaded by students. This would be a good feature to add to our todo list.<br />

For now if you want to remove a file, or rather the reference to a file, you'd need to do it manually by removing its listing in the database. Not ideal I know.</p>
