				<p>Hi everyone,<br />
I'm building a new testing site and have been looking at a number of different LMS and PHP framework options when I stumbled upon aTutor. <br />
The site itself is relatively simple but I have not found anything as of yet that has suited my needs and was wondering if you could let me know if this system would work in aTutor. <br />
Essentially a teacher would sign up and add flash based tests to their course from a list of available tests. They would then enroll their class (the students will not be in the system and must be added by the teacher).<br />
Students would log in and be shown a list of test and there current completion status. Clicking on a test would either start the test, resume the test or show their results.<br />
Does this sound like something that can be accomplished with aTutor or should I continue looking for options?<br />
Thanks for taking the time,<br />
Rob</p>

				<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
Once you have logged into ATutor and have created a course.  There is an icon called "Test & Survey" and you will find all you need in there.<br />
<br />
To create a test, you will then have to log in as the instructor, manage, test & survey.<br />
<br />
This will also be helpful: <br />
