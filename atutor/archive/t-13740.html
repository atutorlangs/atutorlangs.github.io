				<p>This probably means the assignment has not been assigned to the group. Chooce the group in the assignment properties .<br />
<br />
<br />
Group members can act on all group files. If you don't want users to be able edit others files, assign the assignment to All Students, and have them submit assignment files through MyFiles</p>

<br />
When I try to assign the assignment to the the group,(manage>assignment>add assignment) <br />
<br />
now,just assign to the type of the group ,can not find the name of the group.   and, when I <br />
<br />
click the "save", show that the assignment had successfully added, but the name of the <br />
<br />
assignmen do not show in the list.(show none foud).<br />
<br />
and then,the student can not use the "hand in".<br />
<br />
tips: the atutor I have being used is the latest stable version ATutor-1.6-pl1, in the demo <br />
<br />
of atutor on www.atutor.ca ,in the file storage ,there are four spaces,such as course <br />
<br />
files,my files,groups and assignmets,but in my system there is not assignments.<br />
<br />
How can I assign assignment to the group ?<br />
<br />
<br />
mysql-5.0.41<br />
php-5.2.3<br />
apache_2.0.51<br />
os: windows xp</p>

				<p>The group you are assigning the assignment to must have members in it before it will show up.<br />
<br />
Everything seems to be working fine on our local installations. I'd suggest starting over.</p>
