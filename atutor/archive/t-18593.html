				<p>Hello.  I have 1.6.2 installed and I'm trying to get the timezone offset to work.<br />
<br />
My server is located in the Central timezone and most students (as well as myself) are in the Pacific timezone.  So, I put a system timezone offset of -2 to have the system time be in Pacific time.  <br />
<br />
When I login as a instructor, I have no timezone offset in my personal preferences, as I live in Pacific time.  When I post announcements the time posted matches the timestamp on the announcement.<br />
<br />
The issue occurs for the releasing of content.  For example, at 5:30PM, I set a piece of content to release at 18:00.  When I save it, it is already released.  When I set that same content to release at 20:00, it says that it will be released at 6:00PM.  With content, there is a constant 2 hr. difference that I can't get away from.<br />
<br />
I've tried this on the 1.6.3 demo server and the same behavior is present.  Go to: http://www.atutor.ca/atutor/demo/content.php?cid=949 to see what I'm talking about.  Or, enter the demo server, and enter course "ABCD".  I've created a piece of content called "Timezone offset issue".<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for helping.</p>

				<p>BTW, the same behavior is present for Tests and Surveys (the start and end times are always 2 hrs. off).<br />

				<p>This is either the result of the server time, the ATutor time set in System Preferences, or one's timezone personal preference setting being set 2 hours off. <br />
<br />
I've confirmed in 1.6.3 at least, that time zone settings are working properly.</p>

I don't know what to say......<br />
<br />
I seem to have everything set up properly as described in the first post.  I have even added code to show the current system time on the User Preferences page:<br />
<br />
echo '&nbspCurrent System Time is:  &lt;b>' . AT_date(_AT('server_date_format'), '', AT_DATE_MYSQL_DATETIME) . '&lt;/b> <br />
<br />
Then, when people do an individual timezone offset, it will reflect that change.  The problem still persists though.  <br />
<br />
Also, did you see my piece of content on the 1.6.3 demo server showing this behavior (http://www.atutor.ca/atutor/demo/content.php?cid=949)?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>
