				<p>Dear Greg,<br />
<br />
Thank you for always careful attention to ATutor users. Personally: it is precisely this detail one of the two things I most value over 11 years of good experience producing online courses with ATutor.<br />
<br />
The problem has been solved in a "unusual" way to what have been dozens of times I've installed subsequent updates (fresh installations and upgrades) ATutor that I have done without difficulty: my hosting provider has suggested to me that first I make the database using myphpadmin (with plesk) and then perform the installation.<br />
<br />
I've never acted that way and I have not seen that ATutor recommend this procedure. But it worked.<br />
<br />
I do not question now if something has changed on the server or to the present I was lucky that this problem has not appeared to be detained in Step 2 of the installation.<br />
<br />
My rudimentary knowledge of the technical aspects do not allow me to know what happened.<br />
<br />
Neither I can know because suddenly there were problems in the database in version 2.2, after updating to 2.2.1 to the point that I found it easier to remove and install 2.2.1 all with a fresh installation, which appears the problem of having to first create the database before proceeding with the installation steps.<br />
<br />
If you're interested analyze what happened for future advances of ATutor I offer to you send passwords to my vps (user ftp access to plesk admin panel and ATutor administrator). It should be in the course of next week because on Saturday March 12th I start up the contents and enlist a group of students for a course that I teach from Thursday 17 March.<br />
<br />
Outside, I commented that there are problems in terms that can not be translated in the "Mobile Theme"; if you want I make a list so you can see what it is; They are not in the language pack "atutor_2_2_en.zip" or "atutor_2_2_es-es.zip"<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
<br />

				<p>Having to create the database manually is not uncommon, if the database user being used by ATutor does not have that permission. Perhaps that permission had been changed. This is described in the Database step in the installation instructions. The fact that a blank screen came up though, is a problem. It should have presented an error message instead. I've made a note in our bug tracker<br />

If you can identify where the language of the mobile theme has not been translated that would be helpful.</p>

Thank you!!!<br />

I attached screen shots made with my smartphone (Android 5.1.1), where the terms or words that are not in the tool translate look, you also attached screenshots.<br />

There appears to be hardcoded langiage in the mobile theme that will need to be replace with language variables.</p>
