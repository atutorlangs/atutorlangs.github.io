				<p>Never mind the system info, though in the future include it. <br />
<br />
To fix the problem add unset($body) to include/lib/enroll.inc.php at about line 153, just before unset($mail) <br />
<br />
[php]<br />
	        unset($body);<br />

				<p>Thanks for that.<br />
Can you also tell me how to:<br />
1) delete more than one user at once (incl all of them)<br />
2) re-email everyone's welcome email to them?<br />
3) create a random passwd for the users when creating them?<br />
4) import a list of users along with their passwds into the student list?<br />
Thanks in advance. :)</p>

				<p>[green] Can you also tell me how to: [/green] <br />
<br />
[green] 1) delete more than one user at once (incl all of them) [/green] <br />
<br />
One at a time, unless you do it via a mysql management application link phpMyAdmin<br />
<br />
[green] 2) re-email everyone's welcome email to them? [/green]<br />
Yes. Unenroll users, then re-enroll them to resend the Welcome message<br />
 <br />
[green] 3) create a random passwd for the users when creating them? [/green] <br />
<br />
No.  The system does not create random passwords.<br />
<br />
[green] 4) import a list of users along with their passwds into the student list? [/green] <br />
<br />
No. Passwords are created by the system based on the persons name.</p>
