				<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
We have a bunch of Questions in the "Test and Quizzes" database.<br />
<br />
We'd like these questions / tests to appear "inline" as Content.<br />
<br />
I noticed on the demo that this is done..<br />
especially here...<br />
<br />
http://atutor.ca/atutor/demo/content.php?cid=2088<br />
<br />
But it seems that when I edit it, it looks like a full on html version, rather than just a reference to the question...<br />
<br />
Is there any way to put a test "inline" with content by reference.. rather than converting it to html?<br />
<br />
(By the way, in that example above.. when I select the answer to my question, nothing really happens...shouldn't it indicate the question has been answered?)<br />
<br />
Thanks for any information!<br />
<br />

				<p>hey there - which demo course are you referring to? (that link won't work from outside a course).  it'll help to get an idea of what you mean.</p>

				<p>Yes, I suppose that would be helpful...<br />
<br />
Sorry.<br />
<br />
It's in the "An Introduction to ATutor LCMS" course.<br />
<br />
Then on the outline there is a list of questions. Any of those questions is what I'm referring to above.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

				<p>it looks like someone added this content as a test and it has no real attachment to the actual test and survey area.  <br />
<br />
this idea tho is a feature we have thought about adding... a way to add things other than content to the menu, like tests (so you could take a test immediately after reading a chapter). is that what you're after?  you could create a content page that links to the test for now...<br />
<br />
thanks for your input larry.</p>
