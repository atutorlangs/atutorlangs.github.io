				<p>I requested my website host to upgrade from 1.6.1 to 1.6.2.  Now when login as Instructor, I get the Start Page only which lists the courses available.  However, when I click on any of the courses, I get error message that "Page cannot be found."  I have logged out and back in several times, but the problem persisted.<br />
<br />
I informed the website host of the problem, they advise that they need help from aTutor to fix it - they advise as follows:<br />
"As to your other question, we have done our best in order to fix the issue, unfortunately to no avail. Therefore, I would kindly advise you to contact the developers of ATutor in order to receive further assistance on that matter. If there is anything else that we can do in order to assist you, please update this ticket with more information on that matter."<br />

				<p>Thanks, Greg.  Only Pretty URL was enabled - I turned it off and I am now able to get into the courses.  I do appreciate your help very much.<br />
<br />
Also, I really like this new look of aTutor - especially the directory being on the left side instead on the right.<br />
<br />
Again, thank you.<br />
