				<p>I have a problem with the storefiles: <br />
My course is public. If a guest leaves a comment in the filestore, then when you enter a user logged on, the comment is viewed as having been made by that user. <br />
Questions: 1) How can delete comments from storage files?, 2) How to solve the problem? Ideally, the system does not allow comment of guests in the file store.</p>

In the meantime, you can access the database directly to delete comments from the file_comments table for the file in question.</p>
