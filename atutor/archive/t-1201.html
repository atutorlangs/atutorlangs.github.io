				<p>Hi <br />
I have installed v1.3.2 but I can't seem to get courses created on other authoring tools to import into ATutor.<br />
<br />
Both packages claim to create scorm 1.2 conformant material and I even tried changing the format to an IMS package but ATutor still wouldn't import it.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</p>

				<p>Perhaps your authoring tool in not conformant, or you have not assembled your content incorrectly. You might try using Reload to build content packages. It works well with ATutor.</p>

				<p>One tool I tried was Lectora the other I am going to try is Course Genie.<br />
<br />
I downloaded RELOAD and followed the instructions in the PDF manual and created the IMS manifest as instructed.  When I used the content manager to upload the coures, ATutor told me there was a bad or missing IMS manifest.<br />
<br />
I will contact the RELOAD people and see what they make of it as it seems strange that I can't get anything to upload.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</p>

				<p>your server is running PHP in safe_mode, which means that a lot of functionality is being limited if you do not make some adjustments to the installation.<br />
<br />
You should disable safe_mode in your php.ini file or change the ownership of the content directories to "nobody".<br />
<br />
We're still trying to deal with the safe_mode issue, hopefully an upcoming release will be more safe_mode friendly.<br />
