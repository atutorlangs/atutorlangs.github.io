			<div class="body">
				<p>I've been contemplating using ATutor at my work, so I'm interested in finding "fall back" solutions - such as maintenance and support - that we can call upon in case of something bad happening.<br />
<br />
I believe have enough equipment to host an installation of ATutor on our own hardware:<br />
* older Dell XEON, 1gb RAM, 1.5GHz CPU, 256k cache, 40gb HD<br />
* bandwidth equivalent of 6 T1 lines<br />
but I would love any links to information on what equipment is needed given different (login) loads on ATutor. If this old XEON is not enough, we can buy a server.<br />
<br />
Again, the real topic here is "maintenance" - purchasing a contract so that if something goes wrong and we can't figure it out, someone else can. There are a lot of support solutions ( http://www.atutor.ca/services/index.php ). <br />
<br />
Does anyone have any personal experience or recommendations? If you are a provider I don't mind reading from you, either.<br />
<br />
  [b]operating system [/b]- Windows 2003 Server, currently on a production/test system in Windows XP<br />
  [b]version of ATutor[/b] - 1.5.4<br />
  [b]versions of php[/b] - PHP 5.2.2 with phpMyAdmin 2.10.1 (Xampp Install)<br />
  [b]version of mysq l[/b] - MySQL 5.0.41 (Xampp Install)<br />
  [b]webserver & version[/b] - Apache (Xampp Install)<br />
  [b]copies of error messages[/b] - Works perfectly<br />
  [b]changes to default settings[/b] - None yet<br />
  [b]web browser being used[/b] - Firefox & IE<br />
  [b]and anything else relevant[/b] - I have a cat.<br />
<br />
Lastly, ATutor the 17 other LMS solutions we looked at closely and the many more before I came up with that list. The clincher was ATutor's ease of setup and expandable modules to handle feature creep once the project is live.<br />
<br />
I looked in the FAQ and milled around here (that helped me get ATutor installed - permissions issue) but I haven't found any writings about what vendors are helpful in times of crisis yet.</p>

				<p>...continuing from the email I sent you earlier.<br />
<br />
We are getting close to launching our support ticketing system (a week or two). If you just need the security of knowing someone's available to help, you might just purchase a 3 pack of tickets to cover emergencies.  Most of the time you'll be able to ask questions or find answers in the forums.<br />
<br />
And, of course, we encourage other providers to offer ATutor services.  You can generally tell from their web sites, the quality of service you might expect.<br />
<br />
This would be a good thread for providers, and their users, to build upon.  You could help get this started if during your search through the list of ATutor providers, you asked a few to talk about their services here.</p>

				<p>That would explain why I'm not getting anything from the 'net - County e-mail isn't getting through very well - we just migrated to exchange three weeks ago and my old compadres at IT are still having issues.<br />
<br />
Greg, if you can either repost here or resend to dgn at alachuacounty dot us I would greatly appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Yes, I've run into the fly-by-night websites that offer low priced hosting and little information on ATutor. My spider-sense tingled.<br />
<br />
And yes, I prefer the old research then fix or augment routine - but in an Elections office things are timely so the support ticket option would save us if something goes wrong during Poll Worker training. I doubt anything will go wrong - we tend to lock down changes to anything during this time - but we have to be sure. In general I like to work on my projects alone.</p>
