				<p>I am using ATutor for a course right now, and I had a student take a quiz earlier today and then retake the quiz, and the first score has disappeared!  The second score is now a perfect score.  <br />
<br />
How do I prevent this from occurring again, or to at least consider only the first score earned, as WebCT allows?<br />

Thanks!<br />

				<p>All I can say is that when I checked yesterday morning, a student had taken a 70-point quiz twice, once earning 55 points and then a few minutes later earning 70 points (a perfect score).  Later yesterday afternoon when I checked student progress, the earlier score had disappeared, leaving only the second, perfect score.<br />
<br />
When I asked the student yesterday afternoon what had happened she said she had forgotten to answer \\\'a couple of questions\\\' and had gone back and corrected that.  Frankly, I\\\'m not sure she knows exactly what she did.<br />
<br />
I admit I\\\'m using ATutor 1.4 and I don\\\'t plan on upgrading mid-course.  This is also my first experience with ATutor.  If there\\\'s some setting I\\\'ve missed I\\\'d certainly like to know where it is.  I will certainly be doing some more checking myself, but this occurrence bothers me.<br />

				<p>Well, I signed on as a student and took the quiz a couple of times, and when I checked in the 'My Tests' area, the student had the option of deleting test scores.  I'm obviously missing a setting somewhere; this clearly isn't the way it should be.  How do I fix this before I give another quiz tomorrow?</p>

				<p>Are you sure you were able to delete a test as a student? There is no delete test function available to students. Unless perhaps a student has been given test manager privileges via and enrollment manager.<br />

Which version of ATutor are you using?</p>

				<p>Glad you solved the problem. Missed the version number when I was scanning through the thread this morn.<br />
<br />
FYI<br />
In 1.4 students could delete automatically marked test, which were intended to be practice type tests. We've  changed that in the current version, so automated tests can no longer be deleted by students. <br />
<br />
Just a note of caution, online testing is a risky business unless an invigilator is present. It can be difficult to gauruntee the test taker is the person they say they are. Be aware of this if you are basing students' marks on their online test scores.</p>
