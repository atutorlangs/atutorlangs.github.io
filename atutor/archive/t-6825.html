				<p>hi, <br />
<br />
we have just moved servers, upgraded Atutor and moved most of our courses throught the backup / restore backup feature. as most of our users should not be moved, as well as several courses, we found this to be the easiest way. <br />
<br />
..but we have one course where I will add all the users again. I have exportet all the content, but this course has also used the forums quite a bit, and I would really like to export these forums and the content of them to the new server. is there any easy way to do this, or will I have do do it manually? (it's about 30 threads with 2-10 replies each)</p>

				<p>There's no easy way to backup forums at the moment. <br />
<br />
You might try taking a complete backup of the database, and restoring it in its entirety on the new server. Do the same for the content directory, copying it from the old server to the new.</p>

				<p>damnit, thought so.. <br />
<br />
I think I just have to do it manually as it's only this course, and as we will not change servers in this fashion again.. thanks anyway!</p>
