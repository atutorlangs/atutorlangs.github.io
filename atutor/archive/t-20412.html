				<p>Hopefully this helps someone else who may have the same problem either upgrading or during a fresh install.<br />
<br />
During a fresh install of the latest ATutor Stable (v2) the installation would halt during step 2 while importing the DB Schema. The behavior indicated several tables would be created and many more failed to be created.<br />
<br />
Inside the &lt;Atutor Root>/install/db/ folder there are two files "atutor_schema.sql" and "atutor_language_text.sql" that are applicable to new installations and the remainder appear to indicate schema changes for upgrading.<br />
<br />
In any case they use the syntax TYPE=MyISAM which is a deprecated syntax and has been removed as of MySQL 5.4.4. Performing a quick SED replace of this to make this use ENGINE=MyISAM corrects the problem and lets installation proceed as normal.<br />
<br />
Affected platforms/users:<br />
<br />
MySQL Server Version >= 5.4.4<br />
ATutor Version = 2 (Most likely all previous versions will be affected the same way)<br />
Fix: Update Schema Syntax in install directory.</p>

				<p>Thanks, good to know.<br />
<br />
Ever since MySQL 5.3 new db problems have been occurring. Changes are happening to mysql. For now we'd suggest stay with a version less than 5.3, until mysql restabilizes.</p>
