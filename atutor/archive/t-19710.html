			<div class="body">
				<p>Hello.  I still have 1.6.2 installed (waiting until the next version to upgrade) and I'm having an issue with the File Storage.  <br />
<br />
About 2 weeks ago, it began taking a REALLY long time for files to download (and I'm talking about small .pdfs, not enormous files).  For example, a student would go to download a file, then literally about 10-20 mins. later it would suddenly download.  <br />
<br />
Other students have reported the download progress stalls at 99%... then suddenly completes several mins. later.  For me, firefox reports "One active download (Unknown time remaining)" during the download time.<br />
<br />
This behavior does not happen when selecting an image file, then clicking "edit".  It displays the image immediately (not for .png's however).<br />
<br />
This is a fairly recent development and I haven't changed any files or server settings recently.  I'm not even sure of what server information to give at this point.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

				<p>Honestly, this is hard to tell without further investigations. It could 'cuz of the network speed, server settings or the scripts. If you didn't modify your ATutor scripts, unlikely to be ATutor script problem.</p>

I have made some modifications to my ATutor installation.  However, I haven't done anything in a while and this is a recent occurrence.  <br />
<br />
Any ideas on where to start digging?<br />

Thanks.</p>

				<p>1. find out whether the download is slow across ATutor. Try to download different things in ATutor, for example, one small file in file manager or file storage, course backup, export a content package. If the slowness is only at certain things, check the size or anything special with the download file or back-end process.<br />
<br />
2. If everything in ATutor is slow, try to download something out of ATutor but residing in the same server, if the slowness is common, might be server or network related. Contact your hosting company in this case.</p>

The delay seems to be with all things ATutor.  I've downloaded files, content packages, and course backups and all result in the same effect.  <br />
<br />
In trying a bit of troubleshooting with the webhost, they indicated that it's not so much the download itself being slow, but there's something that's causing it not to actually begin in earnest for several mins.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

				<p>OK. This happens a few weeks ago? If no ATutor script change at then, doesn't seem to be ATutor-related. I've said whatever in my mind in the previous thread.</p>

				<p>Yes, this has been a problem for just the past few weeks.  <br />
<br />
Also, links to files placed in content pages work fine.  Like if I write, "Please take the Unit 10 Test", then insert a link to the Unit 10 Test document directly it's fine.<br />
<br />
To me, this seems to indicate a problem with the download script/process for downloading files via File Storage, content packages, and course backups.  Does anyone know what these things all have in common that direct linking does not?  Greg perhaps?<br />

				<p>Nothing jumps out at me, but maybe your server is getting busier. Try turning on the cache by defining a writable cache directory in system preferences. You might create the cache dir under your current content dir.</p>

Ok.  Through my webhost, I have a cache dir. set up at /home/my_username/tmp/cache.<br />
<br />
So, should that help to fix the problem or is this trying to gather data to help figure out what's going on?  I'm not really sure what a cache dir. does.<br />

				<p>Sorry for the double post.  But one more thing I just observed...  <br />
<br />
I chose to save a file to my computer (Test Answer Form.doc) instead of just open it.  The file downloaded immediately, however Windows is telling me it's name is "Test Answer Form.doc.part".   When I click properties, the file size is the same as it is on the server (23.5 kb) and I cannot open it, nor can I rename it to "Test Answer Form.doc". <br />
<br />
Does this give us anything?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>
