				<p>I have the latest stable version of Atutor uploaded to my website at GoDaddy. I have tried using the file manager to upload both pictures and powerpoint presentation. It uploads the files. Then I try to use the pop-up file manager to link to them in content. I can see the links but when I click on them I get a page not found error. I have uploaded both manually and through and FTP tool with the same results. When I go to my website folder directly on the server I can see the files there but they do not open. I have tried uploading the ppt both as a presentation and as an htm file with the same result. Can someone please tell me what I am doing wrong?</p>

				<p>You're the second to report this problem on godaddy, so I'm guessing its a webserver setting that's the problem. What does your service provider say about the problem?<br />

Try importing the attached package into a course. It should display 3 Flash screens.</p>
