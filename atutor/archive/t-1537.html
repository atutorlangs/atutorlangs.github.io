				<p>I have two more quick questions. I'm not a programmer but I"m learning.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'd like to disable the export content function that appears on each page of the course.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to "roll up" the menus so that the only link<br />
on the right that is seen at the start of the course is <br />
"Open Menus" I would like an option to limit menues in the future, but I understand that it is against the philosopy of the program. Some linear learning is a good thing depending on the objectives.		:P</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>You can set course preferences to limit	what gets displayed (though this isn't working quite right in the current release). You could also capture a preference string from your own account listing in the atutor members table after setting your preferred ATutor configuration, and copy that string into the database query submitted when a user registers. <br />
<br />
Utimately though it is the learner who decided what tools are displayed, if they want to change their preferecne settings. <br />
<br />
In ATutor 1.4, you'll be able to modify templates to control what, and how, functionality is diplayed.</p>
