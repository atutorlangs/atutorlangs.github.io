  and anything else relevant - My site was hacked and at first it appeared to be php files that were damaged because it was the images that weren't showing up, and one of my classes disappeared and there was a commercial homepage where the ACollab groups should appear.  I've reloaded all the php files and no still no images. And the homepage won't go away.</p>

				<p>It is difficult for us to know what's happened, and thus help solve the problem. This is something you will need to investigate.<br />
<br />
First I would suggest using ATutor tools instead of ACollab. ACollab is no longer being supported.</p>

				<p>Hi Greg, thanks for your reply. The reinstall finally solved the problem of the company homepage appearing in the ACollab groups window. <br />
<br />
The problem I am still having is with the images and I don't believe that's from hacking as the ATutor Logo space had a question mark on it right from the install page. I tried changing permissions on the image files but nothing happpened. Maybe I need to log out and in again. But my thinking is it must be in one of the php scripts only I don't know where to look for it. I'm using the new classic template.   <br />
<br />
I plan to move my students into tools in the fall but their work from the spring is still in ACollab.</p>

				<p>Make sure the path to the uploads directory is correct in include/config.inc.php.<br />
<br />
Right click on a broken image and copy the image location to see where it is looking for the images.</p>
