				<p>I really like the 1.6.2 being able to install themes automatically. <br />
<br />
The themes made by Allied Learning Solutions are great in that they look good and are easy to change especially since they have included the graphics in the PSD format. <br />
<br />
However I have trouble with working with all their themes with Firefox 3 under Linux. Most things work, but "the file" storage page and "adding questions" page is broken using FF3 / Linux.<br />
<br />
I understand that this is 3rd party themes and this may not be the right place to post, but it would be really nice if someone could check it out and confirm the issues. <br />
<br />
The standard ATutor theme seems to work perfect in all browsers, but then the header is much more difficult to change.<br />
<br />
At least for me :)</p>

				<p>We are aware of the file storage layout problem.<br />
<br />
We are a little buried in other things at the moment. so can't give this attention right now. As I recall it took a little effort to get the default theme to behave with file storage as well. If someone wanted to try to fix the problem, perhaps by copying the default code into the broken theme, or even deleting the file from the 3rd party theme, we'll update the theme repository.</p>
