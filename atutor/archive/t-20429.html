				<p>Operating system ATutor is installed on -- Windows 2003 Server Standard Edition <br />
  ATutor version - 2.0.<br />

First of all thank you very much in advance four your support at this forum.<br />
<br />
We have been upgrading to ATutor 2.0 from 1.6.4 on a developing environment and we have the following problems:<br />
<br />
1.Although jpeg support is enabled in php configuration (see attachment), a warning message is showed during the first step of the installation process (see attachment).And as a consequence, jpeg formats are not recognized.<br />
<br />
2. Multimedia files are not found unless content folder is located into another folder called ATutor (for example. C:/ATutor/content). The error message when content folder is not into an Atutor folder is: <br />
Not found. <br />
The requested URL/ATutor/nombrespresonas.swf was not found on this server.<br />
<br />
3.We have tried to import several kinds of content packages (Common cartridge and IMS packages created in ATutor, and Common Cartridge and SCORM 1.2 packages created in Common Cartridge builder and RELOAD) and import always failed, with the next error messages:<br />
 <br />
The following errors occurred:Import failed. Does not appear to be a valid content package or common cartridge: In this package, the files, resources/../nombrespresonas.swf, is missing or misplaced.<br />
<br />
Or  <br />
<br />
Field 'allow_test_export' doesn't have a default value.<br />
<br />
That was both independently of checking or not the "Ignore validation" box. <br />
<br />
When import fails, the folders for packages courses are created into content/import folder.<br />
<br />
We have been testing the upgrading of ATutor 2.0 at a local installation (wamp package: Apache 2.2.11; PHP 5.2.9-1; MySql 5.1.32) and only the problem with jpeg format files goes on. Import content works well. <br />
<br />
Please, we would be very grateful if somebody could help us in fixing  or solving these problems.<br />
Thank you very much in advance.<br />
Maria</p>

				<p>First I'd recommend a version of php less than 5.3. Current higher versions are somewhat unstable, and could be the root of the problems you are experiencing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bypassing validation is a "use at your own risk" feature. If a package won't validate, you need to talk to the developers of the tools that created the package etc.<br />
<br />
What do you mean by "jpeg formats are not recognized?" If you look at a course's properties screen, at the bottom where you upload a course icon, is jpg listed as an option, or is it just gif and png?<br />
<br />
Re #2 not sure what's happening there. I can't reproduce the problem.</p>

				<p>Thank you, Greg.<br />
<br />
Referring jpeg formats, in fact, only gif and png formats are listed as options in course's properties screen. Perhaps this problems with jpeg formats is due to php version as you pointed.</p>
