				<p>Hi, just experienced a strange thing. <br />
<br />
I wanted to make a test to a course we're having, so I added questions to the question database, made a test, and wanted to add questions by clicking the "0 questions" in the questions row for that test. <br />
<br />
When doing this I'm told that there are "no questions available", even though there [b]are[/b] questions in the question database...? <br />
<br />
I've done this successfully earlier, but now I get the same message for all my courses.. Any ideas why? <br />
<br />
I've only made very small changes / adjustments to the CSS file for the theme, nothing in the code. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are asking for help, provide lots of detail so problems can be reproduced.<br />
<br />
Things to describe: <br />
  operating system - win xp<br />
  version of ATutor - 1.4.3<br />
  versions of php - 4+ something (the recommended) <br />
  version of mysq l - (the recommended) <br />
  webserver & version - apache 1.3 (the recommended) <br />
  copies of error messages -<br />
  changes to default settings -<br />
  web browser being used - firefox<br />
  and anything else relevant -</p>

				<p>I'm unable to reproduce the problem. It's difficult to say what it might be. I assume you've tried restarting your browser. <br />
<br />
Take a look at the questions you've added recently via the question database and see if there are any odd or special characters in them.</p>

				<p>I've tried some more now, but with no luck. I realised that the tests worked fine before I started translating and before i included aCollab in my installation, so I turned off translator mode and removed the aCollab integration lines from my config.inc.php, but it had no effect. <br />
<br />
I've restarted the browser, and tried several browsers, so it's not a browser issue. The questions are in english and have no special characters. <br />
<br />
The tests I had from before still works, but I get the same message if I try to include new questions there now. I've got this problem in (all) three courses now, and in any new course I start.</p>

				<p>Hm, it works again now, but I have no idea why. I did install aTutor 1.5 on the same server (but different database), tried it a bit, then removed it again. And now the tests works like there was never anything wrong with it.. I just hope they continue to do so :)</p>
