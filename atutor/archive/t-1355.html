We are using Reload to package.  However, when we import a content package..... and then look at our file manager.... none of the html files that were included in our zip file show up in our file manager.  Can I e-mail you our package?  Or, is there something we should try? Also, my team has discussed either offering some development or funds for further development.  Who do I contact about this?</p>

				<p>HTML file are integrated into ATutor as content. They will not show up in your filemanager. You would use the content editor to access these files once imported. Only the supporting files (images, media files, downloads etc) are loaded into the file manager.<br />

I'm the person to talk to about development. Use the contact form on atutor.ca to contact me, and we'll continue an email discussion from there.</p>

On our system.... if we create a course and then go to the content editor... and add content (directly or by upload) then save..... it does not add the content into the menu system.  We went out to the demo course and we can do everything... import CP\'s add content etc.. and everything shows up as it should.  Interestingly enough on our system, if I add content and preview it before saving... it shows the new content in the menu system... but as soon as I click save it vanishes.  Obviously we have a setting misconfigured on our system.  Can you point me in the right direction?  I\'ll e-mail you soon about our desire to get involved with funding the project.<br />

Thanks.</p>

I decided to wipe everything out and do a clean install of 1.3.3.  We were only testing out so we didn't lose anything.  We probably just go it sideways when we did the last upgrade.  Everything works great now.</p>
