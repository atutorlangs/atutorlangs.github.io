				<p>Hi guys! A certified, total Newbie here. I guess I just want to ask, what's the best Linux Platform for Atutor? Best meaning the fastest, least problems. Does it work better in Linux than in windows? If so, what release is the best to use (Redhat, Fedora, Suse, etc.)? <br />
Does Atutor run on E-smith? I have an e-smith box running on school network, version 6.0. We only have about 8 computers.<br />
<br />
I'm planning to setup one because I am a part time teacher, and I must say I am very impressed with atutor's features and I can't wait to try it out.<br />
<br />
Thank you so much.</p>

				<p>Reports suggest all Linux platforms work well. <br />
<br />
Windows with Apache as a web server works just as well. With IIS as the Web server though, there are occassional problems reported.<br />
<br />
It should run just fine on e-smith Linux. We've heard no reports otherwise. As login as it supports php/apache/mysql.</p>
