				<p>the people on the "not enrolled" list are all the users of the system that are not enrolled in the specific course you are viewing. deleting them could be a very bad idea.. <br />
<br />
to delete users in general, log in as admin -> users -> select the ones you wish to delete -> chose delete in the dropdown meny -> apply</p>

Doesn't showing the data of all the users of a system to anyone who's managed to become instructor pose some threat to the system, especially a large one?</p>

				<p>I agree. this is one of the reasons we are very hesitant to let other people than ourselves (the admins) be instructors. It also has some privacy issues I believe. <br />
<br />
one solution could be to remove *this part* of the enrollment manager for instructors, as there is now an enrollment manager available for admins. <br />
<br />
related, there should be an option to add other contact persons than the instructor for a course. now we are the instructors for our courses, which means we get e-mails from the system when people ask for enrollment, not the ones who should be managing this (assistants).</p>

				<p>I would agree with you both. There does need to be a way to turn off enrolment for instructors, or on a course by course basis. <br />
<br />
As for the ability to add people to a course from the Not Enrolled list, that too needs to change. We've had a couple instances ourselves on one of our servers where an instructor enrolled the entire student list in a course. I've added this to the bug/feature tracker for consideration in the next release.</p>

You have confirmed my thoughts how to manage user accounts and I am glad that the Administrators and the Instructor are one and the same.<br />
<br />
The upgrade to ATutor 1.5.4 went well or so I thought. As it turns out I found that Mysql 3.23.49 and php - 4.4.1 are my current versions and not the versions I was told I had from my server supplier. <br />
<br />
After digging around in the forums I found and used phpinfo which leads me to believe I need to upgrade Mysql because of the following error I receive when trying to bring up the users list (there is no list coming up).<br />
<br />
Under the Users tab I get the following error as an administrator:<br />
<br />
Warning: mysql_fetch_assoc(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in /opt/hydra/aerotheory/httpd/htdocs/ATutor/admin/users.php on line 345<br />
