				<p>I have a manufacturing client that structures their training based upon their organizational structure.  Below is a simple view of what is needed.  Does ATutor support this?<br />
<br />
Structure:<br />
<br />
Course 1<br />
Course 2<br />
Course 3<br />
Course 4<br />
Course 5<br />
<br />
Student A (Job: Supervisor)<br />
 - Course 1<br />
 - Course 2<br />
 - Course 3<br />
 - Course 4<br />
 - Course 5<br />
<br />
Student B (Job: Lead)<br />
 - Course 1<br />
 - Course 2<br />
 - Course 3<br />
<br />
Student C (Job: Line Worker)<br />
 - Course 1<br />
 - Course 2<br />
<br />
<br />
Function:<br />
<br />
The student is registered and assigned the courses based upon their job/category/position.<br />
<br />
When Student C logs in they see the courses assigned to them<br />
 - Course 1<br />
 - Course 2<br />
<br />
When Student B logs in they see the courses assigned to them<br />
 - Course 1<br />
 - Course 2<br />
 - Course 3<br />
<br />
When student A logs in they see the courses assigned to them<br />
 - Course 1<br />
 - Course 2<br />
 - Course 3<br />
 - Course 4<br />
 - Course 5<br />
<br />
When any student logs in they see their assigned courses and which ones they have completed (or a percent completion)<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.</p>

				<p>You would use the admin's Auto Enrollment tool to set this up. Login as the admin, then go to Courses>Auto Enrollment<br />
<br />
You would create three separate enrollments, perhaps with titles like "Line Worker Courses" Choose from the available courses the ones that should be assigned to each enrollment category. <br />
<br />
Once each enrollment has been saved, a link is created that when followed will enroll the registrants in each of the assigned courses.  You'd send that like to workers, or perhaps create links on the parent Web site workers could follow to register for their courses<br />
<br />
See the Handbook page on Auto Enrollment, top right while on the Auto Enrollment screen for more details. You can try it out on our demo site. Use the Administrator Demo.<br />
<br />
http://www.atutor.ca/atutor/demo.php <br />
<br />
To setup percent complete, you'd need to install the Certify module. Not sure though if it will serve your purpose. You can see the readme with the module to determine if it does what you need.<br />
<br />
https://github.com/atutor/certify/blob/master/README<br />
<br />
Being Open Source, there's always the option of modifying things to work the way you need them to.</p>
