				<p>I know that as the database gets bigger so will the reqs.  but, what is a good starting point in terms of server reqs.  I'm thinking of installing Atutor in a company, as a starting point around 150 people will use it, then if Atutor works well, the company will upgrade the user base to the full company (around 2,000) employees.  Since I wont really have much access after the installation I want to recommend something that will work.  This is my first time around an LMS so I wouldn't know what the long term requirements would be.</p>

				<p>2000 users is a small number actually. You should not have any problems running ATutor even on lower end hardware. The only thing you might be concerend with is space, if you have a lot of content to upload into your courses, particularly video, and to a lesser degree audio files.<br />
<br />
If its just text and images, any hardward back to even an old P1 should work. Of course if you do want performance, something more modern would be needed. Any current low end system should be all you need for the number of users you have.</p>
