I click on the link to "create it now" which takes me to the following URL:<br />

Somehow that URL does not look right?</p>

				<p>Sounds like something has changed on your server, if it was working before. <br />
<br />
You should not need to "create it now." It may be giving you the error because it already exists, but perhaps is not writable. We have in the past seen this problem caused by ISP settings that prevent the creation of writable directories. You'd need to talk to you ISP, or system administrator to determine if that's the case.<br />
<br />
You can try to reset the permissions on the content directory by running the following command on the content directory.<br />
<br />
prompt>chmod -R 777 content<br />
<br />
You may need a sysadmin to change the permissions.</p>

				<p>I did notice that I have two content directories. One inside Atutor and one outside. The inside one was created by the installation script and the outside one was created by configuration. Would that create a problem?</p>

				<p>Did you upgrade from a previous version of ATutor?<br />
<br />
Content directories are created manually, the installation script doesn't do it. Edit the include/config.inc.php file to point to the content directory you created as per the instruction in the intsaller (or upgrader)<br />
<br />
It sounds like there is more going on here than you've described. You need to be more detailed, so you don't have us running in circles.</p>
