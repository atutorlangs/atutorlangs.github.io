				<p>Hi all,<br />
<br />
I installed ATutor on a Linux server machine which had a public IP address. Everything was fine. Then, we needed that public IP address for something else and I had to use dyndns for ATutor server. <br />
<br />
We have a router on the network that has a web server which is using port 80. Thus, I decided to use port 8080 for ATutor's Apache server.(I chose something like - atutorserver.selfip.net:8080) After that, I tested it and it was fine. It was a few days ago. When I checked again today, the log in page for Atutor (login.php) shows blank. I have other HTML pages outside ATutor folders and they are still accessible. I don't know what the problem is. I tried restarting Apache and it started ok. Can someone help me?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.<br />
<br />
Operating system ATutor is installed on - Kubuntu 8.10<br />
ATutor version - 1.6.2<br />
Patch #s applied - 13<br />
ATutor theme name - Default<br />
PHP version - 5.2.4<br />
MySQL version - 5.0.51a<br />
Webserver & version - Apache 2.2.8<br />
Changes to default settings - none<br />
<br />

				<p>We're not familiar with dyndns. <br />
<br />
You might start by telling them what you've  described here. If it was working yesterday but not today, something on the server likely changed.<br />
<br />
The change in ports should not be a problem.<br />
<br />
ATutor is generated HTML, unlike usual static HTML pages. So there could be a problem with the PHP, mysql, or maybe the apache configuration.</p>

				<p>Hi Greg,<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for the suggestion. It was indeed a wrong configuration in MySQL's config file. I changed the IP address of the server and forgot to update the address in the my.cnf file.</p>
