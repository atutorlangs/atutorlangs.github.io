			<div class="body">
				<p>hi, have this strange problem. trying to import SCOs to my installation, and get the following errors:<br />
<br />
[b]when uploading from my computer[/b] <br />
<br />
The following errors occurred:<br />
    * Problem with Package Directory.<br />
<br />
[b]when importing from URL [/b] <br />
<br />
The following errors occurred:<br />
    * You did not select a file to upload.<br />
<br />
There should be nothing wrong with the SCOs, as I've uploaded several SCOs from the same tool earlier. also, I did manage to upload one of the packages to the Atutor demo server here.. <br />
<br />
any ideas? what are the correct permissions for the sco directory and the dir/file when uploading from web?</p>

				<p>further info: I cannot upload the file via the Atutor demo server either, it also reports that I did not select a file to upload. <br />
<br />
the file / URL is here though: http:///www2.helsekompetanse.no/atutor-scorm/mpw/42UnderlyingCausesOfConflicts.zip<br />
<br />
I've tried to set different permissions on the file, right now it's chmodded to 777, same with the folder, so . <br />
<br />
I've experienced this problem on and off before, sometimes it works, sometimes not, and I cannot seem to find any pattern at all.. <br />
<br />
what are the correct permissions for the sco-folder and files anyway?</p>

				<p>The SCO linked above seems okay. <br />

Make sure the the max_upload_filesize is sufficient in php.ini, and for the course property. <br />

The sco folder should be 777</p>

				<p>max_upload_filesize is sufficient, and course properties are set to unlimited / max. I've uploaded several SCOs like this, which was much larger before. <br />
<br />
now I was able to upload this at your demo server (didn't earlier though!), but still not at any of my servers (two different servers, see my profile for the specs). <br />
<br />
I get the "problems with Package Directory" error all the time. the atutor/sco directory is 777 - the folders inside this are 755.</p>

				<p>Everything inside the sco directory should be owned by the web server's owner (probably nobody)<br />

As root try recursive write permissions (-R 777), or start over with a new sco directory with the recursive switch on when setting the initial permissions.</p>

				<p>thanks Greg, changed this at the one server where I am root, and it worked! have notified root at my other server to do this, so hopefully it's done by tomorrow. I'll post the results here for reference) <br />

(strange thing is that I uploaded several SCOs to this server just last week, with no particular problems.)</p>

				<p>..and setting recursive 777 on the other server worked as well. thanks, good to know!<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that starting out with a new sco directory could be a bit troublesome, as there were many sub directories within in, owned by the webserver, making it hard to move them to a new directory? the sco directory has followed us through several versions of atutor, as noted here: <br />
<br />
http://www.atutor.ca/view/7/10462/1.html<br />
<br />
..and I did not want to take the risk of doing anything that could affect the other sco's allready running / uploaded. <br />
<br />
(while I could change permissions on the actual sco directory, I could not make it recursive, as the server has ownership to the directories made when uploading through the app.. )<br />
<br />
there hasn't been any changes done at the hosted server as I'm aware of, but maybe there's been some hickups as the directory has been moved between installations / version..? Thanks anyway! :)</p>
