				<p>Hi and thanks for the great work!<br />
<br />
I have an odd problem. When looking at a course with a Flash button that opens a new html window with an Flash film in it I can see it in Firefox but IE gives me an error when trying to display the new window. <br />
<br />
IE can't seem to find the html but Firefox works as usual great.<br />
<br />
If you would please take a look at it I mail you an student account. <br />
Logging in please look at point 2.1 in the course "CAD/CAM trin 2".<br />
There click on the filmroll. <br />
Try it with IE and Firefox.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
Best regards JensCBC<br />

				<p>Hi Jens<br />
This goes a little beyond the kind of support we can offer in the free forums. Content development is just to broad for us to offer that kind of help.<br />
<br />
However, I would guess there is something about the HTML that calls your flash presentation that is not compatible with IE, or perhaps an IE setting that's the problem. You might find the answer by entering a few search terms into google. You could also look at some of the examples in the old ATutor HowTo course (which you can download  from our documentation site and imported into your system). There's a couple examples in the Instructor section of the HowTo.</p>

				<p>Hi,<br />
just thought you would find it odd to, that the same Flash file show so different behavoir in IE and Firefox.<br />
<br />
The same Flash tries to open \"oselo.dk/filmligevkt.htm\" in IE (wich means something out of the content directory) and Firefox with the same Flash opens nicely from the conten directory \"http://oselo.dk/content/3/skrubfrserforside/filmligevkt.htm\"<br />
<br />
The path in the object and embed is the same thoug. But thanks and I will google on.<br />
<br />
Best regards JensCBC</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>It is actually quite common for things to work in one browser, but not another. It is a challenge to create an application like ATutor and have it work consistently across browser.<br />
<br />
The same is true for content.</p>
