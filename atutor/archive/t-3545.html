				<p>Firstly, you are mistaken about providing other replies, and secondly, don't expect an immediate reply ... or even free help for that matter :-\ . There had not been two hours since your initial message. Some questions take longer to answer that others, and we'll help you when we can. tsk, tsk<br />
<br />
What I might have said had you been patient...<br />
<br />
What you've described suggest a corrupted file. Try downloading a fresh copy and installing again.<br />
<br />
What is the version number? The "lastest version" can mean different things.<br />
<br />
What happens when you login as an administrator?</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>Firstly, All I did was ask a question - I was simply wondering why the other requests were being answered first. I do not expect an "immediate" reply. But a reply with just TSK TSK is kind of irritating when you are a busy webmaster who already works 14 hours a day servicing 1240 clients :(<br />
<br />
Now, on to the matter at hand, the version is 1.4.3<br />
I can't log in at all. When I go to login.php, I get the error.</p>
