				<p>Hi<br />
<br />
My client is using ATutor 1.4.3.<br />
<br />
We would like to change the email notification a student gets when enrolled into a course so that they are also advised to change their password from the default password.<br />
<br />
I am wondering where the email is created. I thought it was created in the enroll.php file however tests show that my addition to the email message doesn't show up.<br />
<br />
So where is the php file that I need to modify?<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

				<p>Hi Greg<br />
<br />
firstly, thanks for your help.<br />
<br />
I have another question. I exported the english language and opened the sql file and found the insert statement I want to change to include extra info in the new account email. However, now I don't know how to overwrite the existing language and I don't want to stuff it up. I can't delete the existing english language because it is the only language on the database. If I imported the changed english language because they are insert statements in the sql file , and for the same table names as the english language, I would imagine it would just append these rows. Should I add a delete rows statement in the sql file so it does that first?<br />
<br />
This import/export interface is the only way I see I can change this email message.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
Rebecca.<br />
