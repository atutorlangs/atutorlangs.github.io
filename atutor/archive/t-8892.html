				<p>If you are asking for help, provide lots of detail so problems can be reproduced.<br />
<br />
Things to describe: <br />
  operating system - Linux<br />
  version of ATutor - 1.5.3<br />
  versions of php - 4.4.4<br />
  version of mysq l - 4.1.21-standard<br />
  webserver & version - Apache 1.3.37<br />
  copies of error messages - none<br />
  changes to default settings - cache timeout changed to 36000<br />
  web browser being used - Windows IE client side  Mac Safari user side<br />
  and anything else relevant -<br />
<br />
Today I asked my students to submit work for the first time on the new version of ATutor with File Storage. They created folders for themselves under the "group" work area, then using the text editor wrote a trial compostion for test submission. The assignments were handed in successfully and the file icons appeared on the course file but when I downloaded them they were all completely blank. <br />
<br />
It all seems so easy and straightforward but the results of their work are not there. After showing them how easy it was to use the system it totally fouled up in the delivery and made me look like a fool. <br />
<br />
How can I get the files to download with all their content intact?</p>

				<p>Sorry to hear about your mishap. I happens to the best of us.<br />
<br />
I wasn't able to reproduce the problem myself. The file created by the group member, downloaded by the instructor, seemed to be fine. I don't have a version of IE handy, but I'd guess it could be the problem.  Try firefox or mozilla. Let us know what you find. <br />
<br />
Is the file size listed next to the file being downloaded?<br />
<br />
Are you downloading more than one file at a time (as a zip)?</p>

				<p>Thanks for the quickreply. I very much apppreciate your willingness to help.<br />
<br />
I was downloading a group workspace folder created on Windows IE as a .zip. The .zip came with the files intact but the content was erased.  <br />
<br />
I tried uploading a file from my hard drive using Safari, then downloaded it and it was also blank. <br />
<br />
I'll try it on Mozilla but the school only has IE to work with.</p>

				<p>I tried this on an XP Pro / IE 6 system this morning and it seems fine. Same with Safari on OS10. My guess is it is something specific to the system you are working on. Or perhaps php's zlib library has not been compiled properly into php on the server end.<br />
<br />
We have in the past heard from users who have been unable to view zip files on some Windows XP systems. We have not tracked down the exact problem yet, so we can create a workaround. Only a small number of Windows users seem to experience the problem.<br />
<br />
You could try reproducing the problem on our demo server, to test whether its your client computer or the server that is the root of the problem.<br />
