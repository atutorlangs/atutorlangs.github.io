				<p>Hi,<br />
I'm asking help for a problem I encountered using Tests/Survey. If I use the Random option for randomize questions, it doesn't work: it listing only the same questions in the same order. By disabling the function, the test show me only 5 (number used for random option) of 15 questions. Moreover into the preview mode I can see it all.<br />
Any suggestion?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

				<p>Are you viewing the questions as different users? Once a set of random questions is generated for a user, they cannot be re-randomized. Users would be able to regenerate the questions over and over until that got questions they liked.<br />
<br />
Preview is for instructors, and will display all quetions. You should test this feature with multiple student accounts.</p>

				<p>Hi Greg,<br />
thanks for the answer and sorry for my late reply.<br />
The problem occurs as different users too. It was tested by a Professor on an Exam Session. All students had the same questions in the same order, even though random option was enabled.</p>

				<p>I'm not having any luck reproducing the problem. I've setup a test at the course linked below. Assigned 5 random questions from a pool of 15, and logged in as 2 different students. They both get two different sets of questions.<br />
<br />
http://atutor.ca/showcase/atutor/bounce.php?course=11<br />
<br />
You can login with <br />
<br />
login:pass<br />
student1:student1<br />
student6:student6<br />
demo:demo (instructor)<br />
<br />
Until we can reproduce the problem, we can't really put too much time into investigating. It could be something specific to your system, someone doing something wrong, or maybe a browser version problem. It's hard to say for sure where the problem may lie.<br />
<br />
If you can help us reproduce the problem, or track down why its occurring, we can post a bug and issue a fix.<br />
<br />
You might try your own test on the above demo site, and see if you can recreate the problem there.</p>

				<p>Hi greg.<br />
I'm not having luck reproducing "all" the problem too. The users see different questions but if I set 6 random questions (absolutely casual number and as is set now) from student1 and student6 I see 9 questions instead of 6. 9 was my preceding number test for random questions.<br />
At this point I think is a bug of ATutor.</p>

				<p>Sorry I've to correct myself. From student1 I see 9 questions, from student6 I see 5 questions. I've logged with instructor account from firefox, with student6 from ie, with student1 from chrome. I deleted all navigation data every try.</p>

				<p>Did you change the number of questions on the demo site, then got different numbers of question for each student?<br />
<br />
That might be a bug. You should not be able to change the questions once a test has started. That will through off the consistency of results.</p>

				<p>Alright! Progress. Try the this experiment once again on your site. First without making changes to a test to confirm the problem does not occur before making a change, then make a change and try again to confirm that that's the problem. Document your steps as best you can so we can do the exact same.<br />
<br />
Then I'll try to reproduce it here, and if successful, post a bug and see what we can do about getting a fix posted.<br />
<br />
And until the fix comes, maybe keep in mind that test can't be changed once they have started.</p>
