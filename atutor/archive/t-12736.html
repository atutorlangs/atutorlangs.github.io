				<p>Dear Friends,<br />
<br />
We have received reports that some users faced technical problems trying to fill out the online surveys prepared for our comparative study on virtual learning environments. After receiving these reports, the surveys have been examined and some bugs fixed, so that we hope no further problems will be experienced. As posted before, these surveys target three different kinds of e-learning platform users, and are located on the sites indicated below:<br />
<br />
a)	Survey for Administrators<br />
<br />
http://canberra.ics.kagoshima-u.ac.jp/comp_study_LMS.php<br />
<br />
b)	Survey for Teachers/Instructors<br />
<br />
http://canberra.ics.kagoshima-u.ac.jp/comp_study_LMS3.php<br />
<br />
<br />
c)	Survey for Students<br />
<br />
http://canberra.ics.kagoshima-u.ac.jp/comp_study_LMS_5.php<br />
<br />
We will greatly appreciate your contribution to our study by filling out the questionnaires for any of the indicated roles. It is our belief that documenting as many and diverse experiences as possible will be important to build a more objective characterization of ATutor as learning platform. <br />
<br />
Thank you very much in advance for your kind support.<br />

				<p>All previously posted submissions are perfectly saved, thank you very much for your contributions, we hope to get some more replies though, in order to gather a more representative sample of ATutor users (administrators, teachers and students).<br />

Best regards  :D</p>
