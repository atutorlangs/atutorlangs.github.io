				<p>Hi!<br />
I would like to know if there is any way to see the HTML files that I uploaded in my ATutor local system using the Content Editor tool.Is there any directory that I can find these HTML files?<br />
<br />
Moreover, I would like to know if ATutor has been used by any companies or institutes and who are there companies/institutes (I want to use this information in a survey, that I am writting in Learning Managment Systems( including ATutor) )   <br />
<br />
Thanks, Christiana</p>

				<p>Content created using the Content Editor is stored in the database, rather than in files. Pasted files using the upload feature at the top of the Content Editor are inserted into the Body area, after which they are saved to the db by selecting the Save Content button..<br />
<br />
<br />
Files can be uploaded however, using the file manager, which can be linked into your content.<br />
