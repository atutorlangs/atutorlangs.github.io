				<p>I'm guessing you edited a file (and broke it), or ATutor is not connecting to the database. Unfortuntely we don't have enough information to help any more than that.<br />

Things to describe: <br />
  operating system -<br />
  version of ATutor -<br />
  versions of php -<br />

			<div class="body">
				<p>I replaced the files that were referred to in the error message with a backup from my web site, but that didn't help.<br />
<br />
OS: Windows XP Pro SP2<br />
Using ATutor 1.5.3.3.pl1<br />
PHP 4.4.1 (detailed PHP information)<br />
mysql Ver 12.22 Distrib 4.0.16<br />
FreeBSD 4.11-STABLE<br />
Copy of error message attached<br />
No changes to default settings<br />
Internet Explorer 6.0.29<br />
<br />
I was adding feedback text to questions in my test database. I have 50 questions. I had done about 30 of them successfully, and then on the next one, these error messages appeared when I clicked Save (to save the question I was editing in the test question database).<br />
<br />
Now I can't log on to the course at all, either as an administrator, as a teacher, or as a student.<br />
<br />
The url of the course site is learnonline.tomsmerk.com, if that helps. I can give you login names and passwords if you'll contact me via private email. (tom@tomsmerk.com)<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
PS - I've got somewhat of an orientation manual written for my course. I'd be glad to share it if you think you can use anything from it.</p>

				<p>Are you on a hosted system, or your own system?<br />
<br />
Are you able to access the database with something like phpMyAdmin, find the entry for the last test question you created, and try deleting it. <br />
<br />
Are there any special characters in the question?  <br />
<br />
What language are the questions written in?</p>

				<p>I'm on a hosted system, StartLogic.com.<br />
<br />
When I tried to access the database with phpMyAdmin, I was unable to, and I have attached a copy of the error message. I also reported this to StartLogic, but their response time is not as good as yours!<br />
<br />
The only character in the question is a colon, and other questions with coons worked ok.<br />
<br />
Language is English.<br />

				<p>If there are problems with phpMyAdmin as well, then it is very likely that MySQL itself is the problem.  Perhaps it was upgraded recently and improperly reconfigured.  Your provider will have to correct the problem.</p>

				<p>I still haven't heard back from StartLogic yet, but I noticed that the problem has been fixed, so they must have gotten my note and went to work on it. I am now able to login and edit my questions. I can also get in to phpMyAdmin now, but there didn't seem to be any damage to the database. Thanks again for your help and suggestions.</p>
