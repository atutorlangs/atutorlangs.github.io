				<p>Hi.  I have 2.0 installed and I've had a couple users over the past couple of day report the following.<br />
<br />
They login, then any link they click after that kicks them back to the login page.  According to them, this seems to go on over and over again, and then sometimes it ends up working regularly, and sometimes it continues to make them re-login again.<br />
<br />
My question: I don't think this is a flaw with ATutor, but do you have any ideas on how I might trouble shoot this with these people?  Up to this point, everything has been fine for them.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

				<p>It might be cookie related. If it happens again, have students delete all ATutor related cookies and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
They might also test with a different browser, perhaps on a different computer, to see if its browser related or not.</p>

				<p>According to this user, they tried with multiple browsers and computers.  Any chance an ISP could block cookies or fiddle with them in some way?</p>
