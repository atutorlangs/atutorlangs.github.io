				<p>I had ATutor installed last spring and everything was fine. I decided to upgrade my hosting account, which involved moving all of my files to another server -- now ATutor doesn't work. All I get is a blank page with the status bar saying the load is done. The hosting company says they just copied all of my files and moved them to the new server. I suspect that the settings for the SQL database aren't correct now -- does that sound reasonable? Only problem is that I paid you guys to set up ATutor for me and so I don't know what those settings should be. Is that documented anywhere other than in the installation instructions that are unpacked when the app is being installed? Thanks.<br />
