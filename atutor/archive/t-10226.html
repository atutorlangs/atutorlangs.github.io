				<p>I am a new user- and have downloaded and installed ATutor with MAMP (thanks to the forum- the installation was relatively painless and problem free) so the system is up and running and I am trying to use it.<br />
<br />
Two glossary queries:<br />
I have created a glossary, and want to have the glossary item listed as Buber, Martin. However, in the text, I will be saying something like, "Martin Buber says, ..." and I want 'Martin Buber' to be able to trigger the glossary item which is listed under Buber, Martin. Is there a way to do this, or a work around? Any ideas?<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, I also hope to create a second course, but the glossary I have made is 'universal.' Is there a way to share a glossary across courses; or failing that, how can I duplicate the correct files so the glossary does not have to be re-entered?</p>

				<p>Glossary terms must match exactly. The reversed version will not match the normal version.<br />
<br />
No way to share from a single glossary. You could take a backup of the course, then restore that backup into the new course, but select only the glossary items to restore.</p>

re: Buber, Martin.<br />
I realize that it is impossible for the glossary to not match (exactly) the text.<br />
I wish there was a way to hide text, so I could have invisible text.<br />
Then, the Glossary item could be <br />
Buber, Martin (1878-1965)<br />
<br />
And the text could be marked up,<br />
As Martin [glossary]Buber[INVISIBLE], Martin (1878-1965)[/INVISIBLE][/glossary] wrote, ....<br />
<br />
and the user would see,<br />
<br />
As Martin Buber [?] wrote, ...</p>
