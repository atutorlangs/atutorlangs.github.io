				<p>I am new to ATutor, and had a query relating to the Test/Survey modules available. I want to be able to create multiple choice / multiple answer questions, which I know is possible, having played with the demo version, on this website. Ideally I want the ATutor to display some sort of question statistics (i.e. how that particular question was answered, by other users - e.g. how many users selected a particular option or a mean / average or something). I guess a graphical representation of this this (a graph or something) would be good, so the user can compare his answer, with what other people selected for the multiple choice/answer question. Please can you let me know if this is possible? I have attached a screenshot of what I wanted.<br />
<br />
I found a thread (see link below) which talks about question stats - not too sure sure if this what I need, as I couldn't load the screenshot the thread refers to).<br />
<br />

<br />
Any help would be appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

				<p>if you're using ATutor 1.6.1 or above the question statistics you refer to is a part of core. <br />
<br />
to see it, make a test, get some submissions, go to admin -> tests & surveys -> [pick your test] -> click "statistics" button.</p>

				<p>Thanks - just seen that. <br />
<br />
It is possible to display those statistics immediately after a question has been answered by the user (rather than the administrator having to navigate into admin area)?I wanted to display question specific statistics, so that the user can get an idea of how other users answered the same question. This would have to be displayed immediately after the question / test has been submitted. A normal user wouldn't be expected to go into the admin area to view this.<br />

				<p>Overall question stats are not available to students. Test averages can be made available using the Gradebook.</p>
