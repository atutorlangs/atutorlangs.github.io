				<p>After selecting 'Submissions', I am unable to see my participants' answers, as well as the input area for my mark, but the 'Save' button no longer appears at the bottom of the test, so I am unable to save my marks. <br />
<br />
The only thing that I changed was to add these tests to the Grade Book (I have subsequently tried to remove them but have been unable to do so).<br />
<br />
I have made progressing to the next unit subject to passing the tests for the unit (this applies to all of the units). As a result of this problem, my course participants are unable to progress to the next unit. <br />
<br />
Consequently, I would appreciate feedback asap.<br />

I am using the free version of ATutorSpaces (I will be upgrading when I have used up my spaces,which should be within the next couple of months).</p>

				<p>It seems to have something to do with the marks the test is out of not being saved when the test questions are assigned marks. I'm not actually able to reproduce the problem now. <br />
<br />
I would suggest reassigning marks to questions:<br />
Manage>Tests&Surveys>[choose a test]>Questions<br />
<br />
Which browser are you using? I see you tried to post to the atutorspaces forum, but you post does not seem to have saved properly.</p>

				<p>Thanks Greg. <br />
<br />
Your suggestion - "reassigning marks to questions" - solved the problem. Thanks for responding to this so promptly. :) <br />

Regarding the forum, I could not log in to http://www.atutor.ca/forums/index.php, so I registered under a new username at http://www.atutor.ca/view/7/25934/1.html, where I could post. <br />
