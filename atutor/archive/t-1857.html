				<p>Hi Greg:<br />
<br />
I know this question is not really an ATutor problem but perhaps you could just offer some advice.<br />
<br />
We now have ATutor 1.4 and ACollab working with our extensive course material (about 500 hours worth) but the teachers have a small problem. We have one solution to the and that is by using ACollab for sending emails to all the students.<br />
<br />
A great many of our students do not have an email address on our intranet server - i.e. hotmail, yahoo, etc and when the teacher sends a course email they do not receive it. I presume that this is because sendmail is not setup to use the university's email server to send and receive email. Would I have to change the sendmail config so that it uses the university email server for the pop and smtp?<br />
<br />
I have no idea really but am I looking in the right direction?<br />
<br />

				<p>I know any course I've taken, an email address has been required, and it is required to register on an ATutor system.<br />
<br />
ATutor will use whatever email system is available to send email.<br />
<br />
It should make no difference whether an email address is internal or from a public site. Perhaps there are filters in place on hotmail etc that are not letting ATutor mail through. You'll have to talk to the hotmail folk about that.<br />
<br />
Excuse me if I'm not making sense, I don't totally understand what the problem is from your description. Perhaps you could rephrase the problem. Also describe the system ATutor is running on.</p>
