				<p>IHi Greg,<br />
Does it matter whether one install Atutor or Acollab first. The reason I ask is that I was able to install Atutor on Windows first and then I was prompted to install modules once I was logged in as administrator. I was able to install the prebundled modules that display, except the Acollab. <br />
Reading through the various postings on the FAQ, it sounds as if some users have installed Atutor first and the other Acollab.<br />
<br />
 I got confused by what I read on the Acollab link &lt;&lt;http://atutor.ca/acollab/docs/installation.php#addon>>  where on the one hand it is said that Acollab is installed first and then it is said that is installed as an addon. There is also statement to the effect that Acollab will be phased out as standalone. Is this already the case (am using atutor 1.5.3.3). <br />
<br />
Question: <br />
1) Should I download Acollab or use the option under install module in Atutor once logged in as administrator. <br />
2) Should I uninstall Atutor, download acollab and install and then install Atutor as an add on.<br />
<br />
Here is the quote from the link I am referring to:<br />
The installation process is made up of six steps each. Each step must be completed successfully without any errors to be able to advance to the next. You will not be able to use ACollab if the last step is not reached successfully. Note that the usage of the terms directory on Unix and folder on Windows are interchangeable ....<br />
<br />
To use ACollab as an ATutor addon, it must be installed in the same database as ATutor. During installation enter the name of the ATutor database as the installation database for ACollab, and choose a table prefix (default is AC_) so the ACollab tables do not conflict with other tables that may exist in the ATutor database. Your ACollab installation must also be located next to the ATutor installation it is being added to, so the ATutor and ACollab directories are side-by-side, <br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
Thanks</p>

				<p>As a complement to the above posting, here is another copy and paste of the Acollab phasing out I was referring to:<br />
<br />
Important: ACollab is being phased out, in favour of extending ATutor, which now includes group capabilities and most of the functionality previously found in ACollab. Users are encouraged to use ATutor instead of ACollab, as support for ACollab will gradually disappear.</p>

				<p>ATutor 1.5.3.2+ now contains all the functionality of ACollab, except for the Calendar, which will likely be available in the next release.<br />
<br />
Generally ATutor installs before ACollab, but it does not really matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
1) Should I download Acollab or use the option under install module in Atutor once logged in as administrator.<br />
<br />
[green]Use both. Install ACollab, then install the module. The module just links the standalone version of ACollab into ATutor [/green] <br />
<br />
2) Should I uninstall Atutor, download acollab and install and then install Atutor as an add on.<br />
<br />
[green]ACollab can be used as an addon. Not the other way around [/green] <br />
<br />
Unless you need the ACollab Calendar, I would suggest not installing ACollab.</p>
