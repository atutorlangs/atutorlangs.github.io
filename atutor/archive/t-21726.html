				<p>I just installed AContent and am very happy with how easy it was to install and use. I have one problem though. I imported some content from my ATutor installation that had glossary items but it seems that AContent does not have a glossary like ATutor.  Is that correct?  The terms do have a link as if there is a glossary - <br />

Thanks,<br />

				<p>No glossary in AContent. Glossary is an ATutor specific thing. The import/export standard used to move content between the systems, lacks a glossary component unfortunately.</p>

				<p>That's too bad. Are there plans to do something so that the export doesn't contain broken links to the glossary terms?  Maybe during the export process remove the glossary tags from the content; then write the glossary terms to a page that is included at the end of the course?  The terms in the content wouldn't be linked to a glossary  anymore but at least they would be retained on the glossary page and still useful for reference. <br />
<br />
As it is now, I guess I need to manually remove the broken links or write some code to find and remove them in the database.<br />

				<p>No plans to add glossary to AContent,  and probably won't unless it becomes part of the Common Cartridge standard. We probably could remove glossary terms when exporting, but maybe it would be better to strip them out when imported into AContent. At least with glossary items in, when moving content from ATutor to ATutor or from ATutor course to course, the they are preserved. Something to think about for a future release.<br />
<br />
AContent is intended to be used with systems other than ATutor that support common cartridge or content packaging standards, so if we add glossary, glossary items will end up breaking when imported into other systems.</p>

				<p>Yes, I guess it would be better to strip them out when imported into AContent. It would be nice to have some way to at least preserve the glossary definitions on a separate page but it's not a show stopper. <br />
