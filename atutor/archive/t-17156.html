				<p>Hello.  I'm running 1.6.2 with PHP 5 on my webhost.  And I have all patches installed.<br />
<br />
I was editing content on a class and it seems to have caused a fatal error.  I keep getting a 500 internal server error whenever I try to get back into the course.  The webhost has worked on it and their current solution is to install a new version of ATutor.  I need to keep the course alive, so I tried to restore the course content from a backup but I got the following....<br />
<br />
Error : PCLZIP_ERR_MISSING_FILE (-4) : Missing archive file '/home/users/web/b1426/ez.liveonlinemathnet/ATutor/content/backups/1/02b841d61d54ae7db2b51e7833bd0692.zip'<br />
<br />
Where else could that file be located?  Is there any other way to revert to previous content manually if I'm unable to locate that file?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

				<p>I just found a way to fix the crash.  I just deleted the piece of content I was editing from the MySQL table and everything seems to be working again.<br />

However, this still highlighted the fact that the backup system didn't work.  Could I still get some help in figuring out...<br />

1.) Where the previously-mentioned backup file is, and<br />
2.) How to ensure that the backup system is reliable for the future.<br />

				<p>The location of the backup is correct, though you can only access those files through ATutor itself, or as the system's root user. There's never been a problem with backups. <br />
<br />
I'm curious why the content crash things. Did you cut and paste from some other app? is there something other than text and images?<br />
<br />
Pasting content from MS word in particular, can break things. Its an MS problem rather than an ATutor one. If you must paste, paste to a plain text editor, then copy and past from there into your content.</p>

To be honest, I don't remembeer what I was doing that caused the crash.  It happened 5 days ago and my webhost has been suppposedly working on it since.  I might have been pasting from Word.  I just can't remember exactly.<br />
<br />
On a related note... Do you know of any decent webhosts?  :)<br />
<br />
Now that I'm up back up and running though, my content doesn't display anymore.  It's still in the MySQL tables, but it doesn't display under the "Content Navigation" heading.<br />
<br />
Any ideas about that?<br />
<br />
As always, thanks for the help.</p>

				<p>One more thing.  I checked the file location of the backup that I originally posted about, and there is no file there.<br />

That's what I meant by wanting to ensure that future backups are successful.<br />

				<p>I've not heard of a missing backups problem before. Its unlikely to be an ATutor issue. More likely a misconfiguration on the host. We have many system running ourselves without any problems.<br />
<br />
Not all hosts are created equal. We don't endorse hosts, so you might try looking through those listed on the Service page of atutor.ca.<br />
<br />
It's difficult to say what's going on with your content. If you have been pasting from Word, results can be very unpredictable. There's not much we can do to help with that, except suggesting not pasting.</p>

Ok.  I checked it out and the only things that I can see that might be of issue are...<br />
<br />
magic_quotes_gpc        = Off  (mine is set to "on")<br />
register_argc_argv      = Off  (mine is set to "on")<br />
zlib.output_compression = On   (mine is set to "off")<br />
<br />
<br />
Would any of these settings conribute to content backups either not being made, or place in another location?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

				<p>The content folder is emptied during the ATutor installation. So, another possibility is your web host might re-install ATutor on the same content folder that results in the missing of the backup files from old installation. In new installation, you still can see the backups listed in the backup page. This information is saved in mysql tables. But the physical backup files in content folder has already gone from content folder.<br />
<br />
You might want to download the backup files and save it at your own location to avoid this headache.</p>
