			<div class="body">
				<p>I am trying to install atutor1.4 on fc3 with mysql 3.23, php 4.3 and httpd-2.0.52, the error I get is:<br />
Directories<br />
Error<br />
    * content/ is not writeable.<br />
    * content/import/ is not writeable.<br />
    * content/chat/ is not writeable.<br />
    * include/config.inc.php is not writeable.<br />
But ls of my directories are as follows:<br />
ls -l content/<br />
total 20<br />
drwxrwxrwx  2 apache apache 4096 May 28  2004 chat<br />
drwxrwxrwx  2 apache apache 4096 May 28  2004 import<br />
-rwxrwxrwx  1 apache apache    0 May 28  2004 index.html<br />
ls -l content/import/<br />
total 4<br />
-rwxrwxrwx  1 apache apache 0 May 28  2004 index.html<br />
 ls -l content/chat<br />
total 4<br />
-rwxrwxrwx  1 apache apache 0 May 28  2004 index.html<br />
ls -l include/config.inc.php<br />
-rwxrwxrwx  1 apache apache 86 May 28  2004 include/config.inc.php<br />
which it means all directories are writeable. Would you please let me know what the problem is?<br />
By the way, i changed ownership of these directories to apache to see if I can get rid of this error, but nothing happend.<br />
Thanks for your forum and quick reply.</p>

				<p>please follow the instructions displayed with the error message carefully during installation. They explain what needs to be done to make the content directory and the config,inc,php file writable.<br />
<br />
use<br />
chmod -R a+rwx content/  (make sure to use the -R switch)<br />
chmod a+rwx include/config.inc.php<br />
<br />
You may want to use ATutor 1.5.1.  It is much improved over 1.4</p>

				<p>Thanks greg, I followed the instruction you wrote but no change. Also I chmod ATutor directory and again no change, please help me to install ATutor 1.4 as I already have ATutor 1.4 up and running on mandrake 9.1 and I can't upgrade it for Farsi language. That's why I need to install 1.4 and then put mysql dump of Atutor database on it and then upgrade to 1.5 or 1.5.1. I have lots of courses on up and running server which I can't bring them in 1.5 easily as i mentioned in my previous topic on this forum.<br />
Thanks again for your support.</p>
