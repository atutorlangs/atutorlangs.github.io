				<p>This is probably a really stupid question, but I'm wanting to allow a word document to be uploadable in response to an Open Ended question (which only seems to allow up to one page).  <br />
<br />
I'm sure this has been asked before, and is probably documented somewhere, but I can't find anything and I need to find a solution pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
Can anyone point me in the right direction?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</p>

				<p>There is not an upload feature with tests.<br />
<br />
You might try using an assignment, and have files submitted through the File Storage utility.</p>
