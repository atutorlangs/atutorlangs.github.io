				<p>I'm glad to hear you have ATutor (sort of ) working on a Mac. There's not many out there from what we've been able to gather from forum feedback. We may pick on you for more info ;-)<br />
<br />
I could not reproduce the error you've described using the demo server on our site. Everything seems to work as it should. See if you can produce the error yourself.<br />

<br />
Regarding you system setup, Apache 2 is going to be problematic. It's PHP support is new and not all that stable yet. We, and the PHP folk recommend against using it in a production environment for now. We can't support Apache 2 yet.<br />
<br />
See the Warning at the top of the page:<br />

Our development boxes, server and many clients are all Mac.<br />
<br />
With your help and Cas Nuy's we really have a unique learning platform as I have the best of both ATutor and PostNuke integrated into our system.<br />
<br />
We have embedded video and Keynote (audio-based Powerpoint-like .mov files) as part of the ATutor content.<br />
<br />
I did not have any issues on the Mac or Apache2 until this release ... and the bounce.php issue could be very well a localized issue.<br />
<br />
I moved to Apache2 a few months ago because on of my pieces needed it.<br />
<br />
It is not a high priority for me at the moment ... by September it will be!  I'll be back at you on this one later, if I can't resolve it.<br />
<br />
If you would like an updated look at how we are currently implementing your wonderful CLMS, let me know and I can email you a user/pass that will work for the (Nova Scotia) Film and Video 12 course.  (I have your email address in my addressbook already)<br />
