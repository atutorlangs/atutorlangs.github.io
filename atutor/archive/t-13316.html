When I want to Download Submission Statistics as CSV data, after oressingDownload button I was prompted to my home page. That wa sthe case if permissions were not returned back on previous state before applying the patch.  I gues in this case is patch 0002 valid.  But, I do not see file that is regulating download of Submission results as CSV so I can change permissions on it.  I see<br />
public_html/admin/tools/tests/results_all_csv.php.00002.old<br />
but I do not see new one.  <br />
Maybe Ia m wrong.<br />
Please advise,<br />

				<p>There does seem to be an issue where the Web server users has permission to write to files owned by the ATutor user. We are looking into the issue now. In the meantime, you can copy and rename the backup file to replace the missing one.<br />
<br />
You can delete the reference to the patch in the patch tables to restore everything back to the way things were.</p>

				<p>Hi wucic,<br />
<br />
The deletion of results_all_csv.php is one of the steps that patch 0002 is supposed to do. This file is not in use any more. Its function has been moved into results_all.php. results_all_csv.php.00002.old is its backup in case you are not happy with the results that the patch brings in.<br />
<br />
We've fixed the problem that the permission states of the files changed by patcher are not set back. The fix will be in the next release of Patcher module, which is coming up soon.</p>
