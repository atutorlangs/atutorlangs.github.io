				<p>Hello all. I am new to Atutor and SCORM packages. I am running Atutor on a hosted web server by siteground.com. I chose them because they offer free installation of Atutor and thought if I had any problems that they could help me get up and running. After trying for a week on my own I can not upload a SCORM file to use as student content. I have done a lot of reading and can not find a definitive answer as to how to do this successfully. I keep trying to upload a SCROM 1.2 Zip file and come up with the erro "problem with package directory" Any ideas? I have attached a file made with Courselab. I have tried to upload a variety of sample packages from the net without success. Thanks in advance.</p>

				<p>You need to install the SCORM Packages module, and during the install create a directory called "sco" and make it writable by the Web server (i.e. chmod 777 sco)<br />
<br />
The SCORM Package's tool plays SCORM Shareble Content Objects (SCOs). You can import SCORM Content Package directly into the ATutor content.</p>
