				<p>Hi,<br />
We have A-Tutor 1.6.1, and I am trying to backup a course to move it to a new server.<br />
The problem we have is our current ISP has placed a memory restriction on running php scripts (hence the move to a new server).<br />
When I try and create a backup of one of my courses (the rest backup ok) I get a PHP out of memeory error.<br />
I have removed all the files from normal file storage (total of about 2Mb).  The only files I have left are some PDFs in the test area, but I am still getting the out of memeory error.<br />
Is there any way to make the backup module verbose? So I can see what files its trying to backup and can maybe remove them manually, then restore them to the new server.<br />
We do not have command access to this server, so everything has to be done via FTP.<br />
<br />
Alternativly, is there any way to manually backup the data via FTP and MySQL access?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Matt</p>

				<p>There's not a verbose setting.<br />
<br />
See what the size of files in the File Manager (not to be confused with File Storage).<br />
<br />
There's not much we can do to help if 2mb is the max file size the server allows. This is a simple setting to change for a provider. <br />
<br />
Yes you can backup things manually via FTP, but without access to the server's shell, you're limited in your options. This would normally be something a sys admin does.</p>
