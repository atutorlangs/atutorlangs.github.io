				<p>I used ATutor nearly a year, but recently, the registration page became blank after my hosting provider switch the server from windows to linux.<br />
<br />
You can see my login page here:<br />
<br />
http://21vcity.com/school/login.php?lang=en,<br />
<br />
when click Register, got a blank page, but it worked correctly before.<br />
<br />
all other pages are working now, but only Registration and Verify page became blank.<br />
<br />
I guess the reason is the differece of case sensitivity or the path between windows and Linux, But I can't find it out, I even don't know how to find it.</p>

				<p>Its difficult to say what the problem might be. <br />
<br />
Case sensitivity could be the problem. It appears to be a customized version of the registration form, passing through the registration_sel.php file (which is not an ATutor file) before linking to the registration.php file, which I'm assuming you have modified.<br />
<br />
You might have a look at the php error log, to see if there is anything there that might suggest what the problem is.<br />
<br />
Also check which version of php you are using, there have been some issues with 5.3.0+ with version of ATutor prior to 1.6.4. In which case you may need to upgrade ATutor, or revert back to an older version of php (&lt;= 5.2.9)</p>
