				<p>Dear Greg,<br />
<br />
I have been working on ATutor all weekend and I have to say that its a very useful tool.  <br />
<br />
My quesiton is another relating to IMS Content Packages:<br />
<br />
When I imported an IMS CP, I found that all the headings/subheading were lost.   <br />
<br />
I have been searching through the menus for the past hour or so trying to figure our if it is possible to put them back and have come to the conclusion that I can;t.  Can you confirm that this is correct?<br />
<br />
I did see though that one of your demo courses has files arranged by parent topic and sub topic,  however I can'f find the control panel for this.  Can you tell me how to create subtopics and move files between them?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

				<p>Depending on what you created the package with, it may be heading were not properly defined by the packaging utility. Content packaging is a very new area of LMS interoperability, and you will find that not all system create packages the same way, or create them in a correct way.</p>
