				<p>If you are asking for help, provide lots of detail so problems can be reproduced.<br />
<br />
Things to describe: <br />

  <br />
We have teacher and his assistants who attend and together create course on mentoring. When teacher and assistants create several polls they cannot vote on those polls.  It seems that wehn someone becomes assistant than that person loose possibilities of student and actually there is no voting possibility. <br />
It may be wuite useful to keep the student's rights despite that fact that someone became the teachers' assistant.<br />
Also, it may be good if below created poll teh students may see the name of author of the poll so they know what is created by teacher and what by assistants.<br />
thanks,<br />

				<p>It's unlikely we'd change that. For most, assistants should not be doing polls. <br />
<br />
You could create a survey with the test manager, with one question.</p>
