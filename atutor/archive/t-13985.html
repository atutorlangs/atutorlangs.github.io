				<p>Hi all,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to create a sequencial course using Atutor 1.6.1 (like the examples provided by ISN and downloadable from the download page which is in this site)<br />
In particular, I would like create a course with a button or a test in each content page.<br />
If the student answers correctly, so it is possible go on.<br />
How can I realize this?<br />
Actually, I can create course with only content and I can create tests separately.<br />
I use Mac OS and Mamp for MySQL and Apache.<br />
I hope you can help me<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Camillo</p>

				<p>hia, there is no functionality in Atutor at this time to help you with this, but it's something I would also like to see in Atutor in some way in the future!<br />
<br />
there are however *many* potential issues here, and many possible implementations. for instance would the download content feature in Atutor be problematic, and probably also the IMS compliance. <br />
<br />
and there are many ways to implement it: <br />
<br />
* create learning paths, so you chose which way to go through ("in this case, would you do a or b"), which would open one path and close the other one. this we have done ourselves with disabling the content navigation in the side menu, and create our own navigation in the content pages. it works, but paths are not opened / closed, and you cannot restore a course from backup without manually changing all the links again.. <br />
<br />
* add some functionality to add question(s) from a test to the bottom of a content pages, and for instance sum up the score after a student have seen all the content pages. <br />
<br />
* add questions to a content page that decides whether the next page is opened or not. <br />
<br />
* and many combinations in here.. <br />
<br />
what would be very cool about this is that you could introduce typical "SCO features" directly in Atutor courses, and create much better learning material, as well as having a more integrated user experience.. <br />
<br />
any thoughts people have on how this could be done, or not done, is appreciated!</p>
