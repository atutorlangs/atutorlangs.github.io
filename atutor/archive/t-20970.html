				<p>If you are asking for help, provide lots of detail so problems can be reproduced.<br />
<br />
Things to describe: <br />
  Operating system ATutor is installed on - Linux<br />
  ATutor version - 1.6.3<br />
  Patch #s applied - 01 - 11<br />
  ATutor theme name - Corporate Blue<br />
  PHP version - 5.2<br />
  MySQL version - not sure<br />
  Webserver & version - Apache, not sure<br />
  Copies of error messages - <br />
  Changes to default settings -<br />
  Web browser being used - FF, IE8<br />
  ...and anything else relevant -<br />
<br />
I've been searching the forum for a way to assign partial marks on a multiple answer question, but I didn't find what I was looking for.<br />
<br />
Basically what I need is to override the mark given if all choices are checked and unchecked correctly with a partial mark. <br />
<br />
For instance, if I have:<br />
Question Type: Multiple answer<br />
Correct answers: 1,2,3<br />
Incorrect answers: 4,5<br />
Points available to the question: 1<br />
<br />
How can I get the system to compute a partial mark if he/she answers correctly, say 3 of the 5 answers (checked and unchecked), giving a mark of 0.6 instead of 0 for that question?<br />
<br />
I would be very grateful if someone could shed some light into this. :P <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

				<p>Thank you Greg. I thought the issue was more complicated than changing the js on the client side...<br />
<br />
I already started trying to figure out how the script operates, but seeing your reference above, it seems a server side modification on the php files would need to be implemented.<br />
<br />
If it's not too much to ask for, could this be considered for a new version. I think it will reflect a more accurate results computation that the current default.<br />
<br />
Thank you Greg, I much appreciate the hint.<br />

				<p>Partial marks is one of those things that needs a funder, or a coder to code the changes and submit them to be included as part of the core.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately there isn't a project on the go right now that we might charge this work to.<br />
<br />
We were hoping the .no guys would get their changes into a state we could use, and merge into the core. Perhaps hearing from you might prompt them to do a little more work on the feature.</p>

				<p>I notice their work was for version 1.6.2, which probably means that unless they get sufficient requests they will not do an update. <br />
<br />
I will submit a polite request and hope they can develop a solution. <br />
