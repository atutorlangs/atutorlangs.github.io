			<div class="body">
				<p>Hello.  I have 2.0 installed and I'm wondering about the auto enrollment feature.  If a student already has an ATutor account, is there a way to send them a link which automatically enrolls them into a course?<br />
<br />
This would be useful for enrolling multiple students into "next year's course" instead of having the course instructor manually sift through all of the registered users and pick out the students who are to be enrolled in that course.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</p>

				<p>Auto-enroll was originally intended for new users, getting them registered and enrolled in a series of courses in one step. <br />
<br />
I suppose adjusting the registration page to ask users to either register or login with an existing user, might be added as an initial step when the en_id variable is attached to the URL. I don't imagine it would take too much effort to create this functionality.</p>

				<p>Ok.  I made some changes to my installation.  I'm happy to pass them along, but they may be somewhat crude.<br />

Let me know if you'd like me to post it or email it to you.<br />

				<p>I think it would be kind of long to post here in the body of this thread.  There were adjustments made to 3 different files and it turned out being a bigger thing than I thought.<br />
<br />
However, I wrote up the changes and I've posted them as an attachment.  If you (or anyone else) wants to use them, go ahead.  Keep in mind that...<br />
<br />
1.) I'm not a professional programmer by any stretch.<br />
2.) My use of ATutor is in the K-12 arena.  So, you may need to adjust some of the phrasing.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps!</p>
