				<p>Hi<br />
I would like to know if there is any relation between the ACollab services, like chat an forums, with the same servicies in ATutor.<br />
In case there is not any relationship, which is tha idea of having both?,<br />
Does anyone have any idea of the way of implementing the use of ACollab, as a tool for the students?<br />
Thank you very much<br />

			<div class="body">
				<p>ATutor and ACollab are separate applications that can run on their own, thus each has its own chat, forums, etc. Both apps can shared a login session which allows a person to login to ATutor and have access to ACollab via that ATutor session. <br />
<br />
Have students participate in group preparation of a paper or project, using the drafting room to share revision efforts, the library to collect resources for their project, and the calendar to schedule online meetings via the chat, record due dates or milestones for a project, or announce other group related happenings.</p>

				<p>These redundant tools create some confusion over the end-user of my applicaiton. Two mailboxes, two forum systems, two chat system... One student connects and use his/her ACollab mailbox, another use his/her own Internet mailbox, a third one uses his/her aTutor mailbox...<br />
<br />
Lot of things to explain to our students.</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>Because ATutor and ACollab are two separate applications, much like ATutor and PHPnuke, or ATutor and Mambo are separate applications, creating a utility that would merge the common features would greatly complicate the interaction between the two.  <br />
<br />
Some day we do plan to recreate the various ACollab tools as part of ATutor, though I expect that will be a ways off. If some group were to fund such work it might get done faster ;-)</p>

				<p>Hi it is me again<br />
May be there is a way to  turn off/ON some of the features of ACollab , so you can configure it  to use only part of the features.<br />
So if I do not want to use the Forum from ACollab, I can disable it.<br />
Another question:<br />
Can I assign an ACollab Group directly to a course in ATutor?<br />
Lets say I want that all the people from de "YY" course be logged in directly to an  ACollab group , is this possible?<br />
Thank you again <br />

				<p>You could easily remove features by commenting out links to these features in the source code. On/Off switches for feature will likely find their way into future versions.<br />

If you install ACollab as an addon for ATutor, each course in ATutor can have several groups of its own. See "ACollab Integration" in the Admintrators section of ATutor HowTo<br />
