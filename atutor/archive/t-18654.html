				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm back to Atutor with a 1.5.5 installation from a first host that I moved and upgraded successfully on my local webserver.<br />
<br />
But, when I put all the stuff on a new remote host, I get some include error (see below) opening the login page.<br />
http://209.44.119.172/~vfpasse/atutor/login.php<br />
<br />
I cannot understand why it is wrong here and right with both the previous host and my local Server.<br />
The included file does exist at the right place.<br />
<br />
I suspect something related to the fact that the to be included file is called from include/vitals.inc.php and the include instruction is <br />
   <br />
    require(AT_INCLUDE_PATH . '../themes/' . $_SESSION['prefs']['PREF_THEME'] . '/theme.cfg.php');<br />
 <br />
and AT_INCLUDE_PATH values "include/" himself...<br />
<br />
Any idea would be very appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

You're right greg!  It's the therme's subfolder that was restricted to 740 instead of 755.<br />

Thank you so much!</p>
