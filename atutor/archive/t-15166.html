				<p>Hello, I have a new version, and just starting to write a course.<br />
<br />
Some problems:<br />
<br />
1. When I go to the course area as a student,<br />
My Start Page > My Courses<br />
Then click on the course link:<br />
/ATutor/go.php/1<br />
<br />
It is empty.<br />
Where should it go to? I think it should go to the course area, where the forums, etc are listed. That's where it goes when I click on JUMP at the top of the screen, but it is empty when I click on the course list.<br />
<br />
2. The Wiki page I added on, but it is empty when I click on the icon.<br />
/ATutor/go.php/1/mods/wiki/index.php<br />
How do I populate or edit this page?<br />
Is there a Wiki template I can use?<br />
<br />
3. I know it is there somewhere, but where do I find instructions on adding and moving around course topics?<br />
For example, the Conclusion went under Introduction, and I am not able to drag/drop it back to the bottom of the navigation section. Other than copy and pasting the whole lesson, is there a better way of moving topics around?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

				<p>Hello.<br />
<br />
#1 and #2 work fine in my installation. Could you please provide information about the configuration of your server as requested under "Things to describe:". It will help the developers to reproduce the problem.<br />
<br />
#3. To move a page, open it and click "Edit This Page". When the content editor open go the second tab, "Properties". You can use the tool below "Keywords" field to move the page around.</p>

I'm not clear on what you are trying to do. It sounds like the server is not setup properly to recogonize index.php, instead defaulting to index.html, which in the case of course links, opens a blank HTML page placed in the content directory to reomve the directory index from view. If this is the problem, you'll need to have your service provider update the webserver configuration to recognize index.php before it recognizes index.html.<br />
<br />
#2 Click on the populate link (I think it called) when you open the wiki for the first time.<br />
<br />
#3 as Indie suggests</p>

				<p>Greg, this is what I mean:<br />
<br />
When I click on Browse Courses from the page below:<br />
http://cultureadvantage.org/ATutor/browse.php<br />
<br />
And then I click on the first course listed, it goes to this empty page:<br />
http://cultureadvantage.org/ATutor/go.php/1<br />
<br />
However, when I go to the MY COURSES on top, with the JUMP link and click on the course, it takes me here:<br />
http://cultureadvantage.org/ATutor/go.php/1/index.php<br />
<br />
So I think that the empty page should also go this page, as they have the same url except, for the <br />
index.php at the end.<br />
<br />
Does this make more sense?<br />
If I add the /index.php to the empty link, do you think this will solve the problem? And how would I add this?<br />
<br />
Thanks. Let me know if there is anything I can do from my end. And if I should contact my service provider anyway.<br />

				<p>I'm pretty certain now the Web server is not configured properly. Adding index.php to the links missing them should fix the problem, but you should mention this to your provider, so the server can be set to default to index.php if the filename is not supplied. There will likely be other places in ATutor where this happens.</p>

				<p>Hello again,<br />
<br />
Yes, after numerous calls to my provider, they can't figure out how to find the go.php folder. The directory index has been set to index.php however, the links are not working.<br />
<br />
I have two options that I need help with:<br />
<br />
1. Where to find the go.php folder <br />
<br />
(Example of links that are not working:<br />
/ATutor/go.php/1<br />
<br />
But it works when:<br />
/ATutor/go.php/1/index.php)<br />
<br />
And afer I locate go.php, what do I need to do to set the default to index.php?<br />
<br />
2. Add index.php to missing links.<br />
Please tell me how to find the links so I can add them as I find them.<br />
<br />
Thanks so much.<br />
