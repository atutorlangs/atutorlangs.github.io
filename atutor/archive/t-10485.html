				<p>First thing you will need to do is be sure system's  php.ini file is configured to allow files the size of a 40 minute video to be uploaded. Once that has been set, you can upload the video through the file manager, then link it into a page somewhere where it can be downloaded by students.<br />
<br />
That said, the video is going to take a very long time to download for most, particularly for students on a dialup modem, unless you have a streaming capabilities. This is possible in ATutor using EPresence and the EPresense module, though it takes a little effort to install. It can do video, chats, powerpoint slides, etc.. The free version of EPresence should work for what you want to do. The paid version adds live broadcast capabilities.<br />
<br />
As for chat and test, the ATutor chat and testing features should work fine.</p>
