				<p>If you are asking for help, provide lots of detail so problems can be reproduced.<br />
<br />
Things to describe: <br />
  Operating system ATutor is installed on - Linux<br />
  ATutor version - 1.6.2.<br />
  Patch #s applied -<br />
  ATutor theme name - Default<br />
  PHP version - 5.0<br />
  MySQL version - 5.1<br />
  Webserver & version -  Apache 1.3<br />
  <br />
When user upload file in file storage its full name is visible from the front end interface. When I work with persons with cognitive disabilities they sometimes forget names or confuse names of files and folders.  I need sometimes to find files manually.  But in /content/file-storage I found files that do have numbers instead of names.<br />
I think that naming may be more explicit for example first 5-8 characters of the file name and number if number is so necessary.  This will help admins in rescue situations to find files in a much easier way.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

			<div class="body">
				<p>Yours would be a special case. For most having the file storage function like other file manager type applications is most usable. Adding numbers to files would be inconsistent with the way other file managers work.<br />
<br />
If something like this were to be added, it would need to be done in a way that numbering could be turned off. If you want to try creating a numbered display in File Storage, we might consider adding it if it's create in such a way that it does not disrupt the current display (i.e. can be turned off), and build it into a set of patches we could apply to the latest stable version, we might consider adding it.</p>
