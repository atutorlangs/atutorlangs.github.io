				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
First of all a big Hi to everyone here. I'm happy to say that I'm almost done designing a new mod Incase I need some help from other fellow programmers, What is the best way? I mean, I'm done with almost 80% of the code, I want someone to test it simultaneously with me and also someone who can integrate it with a small script because I'm unable to find time to do it completely.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

				<p>Thanks.<br />
<br />
The module is called a Course Combo Module. Here's what I'm upto right now. The module will allow the following:<br />
<br />
[b]Courses now have a validity - Right from One Week validity to a One Year Validity - a total of 7 options - DONE<br />
Multiple Cost Association using Ajax - Separate fields for entering costs for a One Week Course, Two Weeks Course and so on up to One Year Course - DONE<br />
Instructor can create Course Combos - Offer discounted packages to students if they want to buy more than one course - DONE<br />
The user will be given an option to enter the validity dates for different courses incase of a Combo Course - DONE<br />
After the validity date is over, the student is unenrolled automatically - PENDING<br />
The user will be able to pay the money over PayPal IPN - PENDING - I think I won't be able to complete this because of time constraints<br />
Administrator interface for a few options - PENDING - Need someone else to do this <br />
Currently supports only English but I'll add support eventually[/b]<br />
<br />
These are the features as of now.. There are more that I added, but I'll add them when I remember them :) And as for attaching the files, I need a little more time, I need to document everything otherwise, it'll be greek and latin. I'll do that after coding the Auto Enroll feature... So, please give me some time. Mean while, I would like to take an opinion from you - as to whether I can get someone to help me out in the development....</p>

				<p>Alright, I've tried adding whatever I can... You cannot install the mod as of now because I'm still working on it. As I've already mentioned, the mod still has to be improved. Let me know what you think abt this...</p>
