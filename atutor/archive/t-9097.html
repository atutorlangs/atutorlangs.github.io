				<p>I agree but I would prefer a less academic structure to some of quiz forms. I teach language and gamestyle activities, such as hangman, concentration, and others, as they have on Quia.com, would be very helpful. Quia costs a lot of money and for me to use it my students would have to go off site.</p>
