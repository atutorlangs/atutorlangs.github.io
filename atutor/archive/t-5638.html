				<p>You have got a bit of an early jump on the ATalker release. We were hoping to make it a surprise, but I guess now "the cat is out of the bag" ;-) ATalker is still coming together. It will be at least another couple more weeks before we make the first public beta release available. You are welcome to explore the source code in the ATutor repository. With an SVN client you can checkout a copy and install it on your system (if you have not already). It is relatively stable in its current state.<br />
<br />
http://atutorsvn.atrc.utoronto.ca/repos/atutor/trunk/mods/<br />
<br />
If you see the README file with ATalker, it will talk about what we do know about setting ATalker up on different systems. We do not have a complete set of instructions for setting up a Windows system (I am assuming). You could help us be documenting what you had to do. <br />
<br />
I believe there are binary versions of Festival for Window, and RPMs for various Linux systems. Otherwise, Festival itself should include compilation instructions. Search the Festival site, or try googleing it.</p>

				<p>There is a popup version. And a public version, so you can use ATalker without being logged into a course.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are on your own for the time being. Once we get the intial version released, we will start providing support (when we can)<br />
