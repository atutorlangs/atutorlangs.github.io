				<p>Hello Greg<br />
<br />
I now have an issue with the questions.<br />
<br />
It seems that if you modify a previously saved question (multiple choice) it removes the correct answer even if you have it selected when saving.<br />
<br />
The result is that the question which is marked as correct before being modified. After being modified, even if the correct answer was selected, at the time of saving it back into the question bank the answer is deleted.<br />
<br />
So that when the question is next accessed, even if the correct answer is selected, the submission results in being told that the answer is wrong.<br />
<br />
I have verified this by looking into my installations database.<br />
<br />
I can create a question (even multiple choice, so long as I don't use punctuation in the remedial content or feedback areas) then save it and it will show in the database as having a 1 in the correct answer.<br />
<br />
If I then modify the question and save it the correct answer is changed to a 0.<br />
<br />
I couldn't check this on the demo site because I don't have access to your database but I have checked it on two different hosts, same software, same setup.<br />
<br />
So could you test this and see what the results are.<br />
<br />
Thank You<br />
<br />
Jim Barnes</p>

				<p>Cheers Amboy<br />
<br />
Slowly working through these issues is giving me a better insight into how the system works.<br />
<br />
Greg is a great help because he keeps suggesting things I hadn't thought about.<br />
<br />
So far we have resolved two of the three issues I have with creating questions and prerequisite order.<br />
<br />
Just need to solve the saving of modified questions now.<br />
<br />

This will go a long way to making the system easier to use for those (like my client) who have no knowledge of how these systems work and panic at the slightest problem.<br />

				<p>Sorry Greg<br />
<br />
I thought this was the post about problems creating multiple choice questions which patch 8 has now fixed.<br />
<br />
The OP is still an issue I cannot modify and save questions without the system changing the correct answer  from a 1 to a 0 when the question is saved.<br />
<br />
As I indicated I tested this on two different hosting systems and the problem is consistent.<br />
<br />
Have you had a chance to check the demo database to see if it happens there.<br />
<br />
