				<p>Hi, I have a setup of Atutor on a production environment conducting some training and class assessments. It is the latest version 1.6.3 and linux, the thing is on my first run I did the tests without showing results and after the test was over edited the course and made is available. Plus I did not apply any patches than... I thing the tests done without applying patches cannot edit the marks... I can go to edit marks but the save and cancel button are not shown only a back button is shown. Some open ended questions are marked as unmarked and so I need to edit the marks on those. Also some of the questions had some mistakes and had to edit the right answer of multiple choice question for which students don't get marks now...<br />
<br />
Is there a way to edit the marks without editing the database tables...<br />
<br />
I hope I made myself clear...<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Yusuf</p>

				<p>Thanks for the reply, yes I can go to edit marks via Tests&Survey>Submissions but there is no save button, but only one back button and clicking on it does not save my editing...<br />
<br />
Need some insight on what I am doing wrong...<br />
<br />
Once again thanks for the early response.<br />

				<p>Maybe you are looking at tests in the student view. Find Tests & Surveys under the Manage tab.<br />
<br />
What theme are you using?</p>
