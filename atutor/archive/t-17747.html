				<p>I create a new test and add questions to it. Some questions are open ended, some are yes/no. <br />
<br />
Because of the open ended question I do not want the results to be released until the instructor has approved (marked) the answers. <br />
<br />
Therefore I select the option: <br />
"Release results - Once quiz has been submitted and all questions have been marked"<br />
<br />
This does not work as I expect, though. The results are released once the test is submitted, and the open ended questions is assigned 0 points. <br />
<br />
Am I missing something here?<br />
<br />
Thanks for looking into this. <br />

Atutor 1.6.2 (my own server as well as the demo server)</p>

				<p>Confirmed. On the way to fix it.<br />
<br />
For now, the work-around is to set the option to "Do not release results". mark all submissions and change the option to "Once quiz has been submitted".</p>

				<p>Thanks for confirming, Cindy, and for the work-around.<br />
<br />
The main use for the tests in my application is that different students that take the same tests over periods of time. <br />
<br />
In this scenario it would be best if tests could not have en expiry date either, but that is another topic...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the answer - looking forward to the fix:)</p>

				<p>Great!<br />
<br />
Is this something which I could patch manually into 1.6.2? I have two installations both in production, and I guess it will be a while before upgrading ...<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</p>

				<p>Thanks a lot for releasing the files! It seems to be working - almost:<br />
<br />
If I have a quiz with both open ended & yes/no questions [i] the results are not released. [/i]<br />
<br />
If the quiz consist only of yes/no type questions [i]the results are released immediately [/i] even though I have set the quiz to "Release results - Once quiz has been submitted and all questions have been marked".<br />
<br />
( Now there may be that this is the intended operation, one could argue that yes/no questions are always marked automatically.)<br />
<br />
In my application it would be great, however, if the quiz would not be released until the instructor has touched it, even though all questions are of the yes/no type. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help.</p>

				<p>You are welcome.<br />

That's how it's supposed to work. All the questions that can be automatically marked are not considered as "unmarked".</p>
