				<p>I am interested in how portable ATutor is, and reports of non-standard platforms running it. So far I have configured it on Linux (Debian stable & unstable, no doubt it'll run on any distro) and MacOSX Panther. People seem to be running it on IIS/Win32, too.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone running it on BSDs other than OSX? Also, has anyone used thttpd, AOLserver or Zeus?<br />

				<p>There have been reports on many UNIX based systems. Issue generally arise with regard to webservers and versions of PHP, than with OSs. ATutor seems to run equally well on current versions of *NIX and Windows.  <br />
<br />
Apache 1.3 is the Webserver of choice for PHP apps. A few IIS user have reported minor issues associated with permission setting. We've had no reports from AOL or Zeus users that I recall. ATutor does not run well on Apache2 systems, though that's likely because PHP support for Apache 2 still has some bugs to work out. You can search the ATutor site, and the forums, for references to other webservers...</p>
