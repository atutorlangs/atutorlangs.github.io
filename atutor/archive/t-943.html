				<p>Hi forum!<br />
<br />
<br />
I need to upload some tutorial as a course, but Im confused about the IMS standards and how to face the problems to adjust some text I use to teach to this standards. As a newbie in this subject I have no experience creating XML files and the metadata needed to create a course meeting the requirements of IMS.  I was looking for a cheap package that let me work in a comfortable way to accomplish this task. <br />
<br />
Could you recommend me one that granted that their result is going to be compatible with ATutor 1.3.1?<br />
<br />
Im in the process of downloading RELOAD it is really large, 2 files of 18 MB each. <br />
 <br />
Whats your opinion of this package, the RELOAD Editor http://www.reload.ac.uk/editor.html. <br />
<br />
Im asking you because to achieve the skill needed to be productive with a package takes time, and I want to minimize the time usually it takes.<br />
<br />
Do you know others?  They need to be cheap or free.  <br />
<br />

I hope that you will understand my English.</p>

				<p>This is a little beyond the scope of this forum. <br />
<br />
Indeed you have to know what you are doing to create packages with Reload. If you use ATutor, it will create packages for you, without having to know how it's done.<br />
<br />
Also see the Microsoft product "LRN"<br />
