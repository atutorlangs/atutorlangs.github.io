				<p>This could be an issue at the server level, like a php version update, or something similar. You might contact your provider to see if anything associated with your account has changed recently. Sometime when a host upgrades hardware, they move sites and break permissions on file that need to be writable.<br />
<br />
You might also try a different browser, or try emptying your browser's cache and any ATutor related cookies.</p>

				<p>Hi Greg,<br />
<br />
thank you for your swift reply. <br />
<br />
I don't think it's browser related: I emptied the browser cache, including cookies and tried 2 browsers (firefox and IE) with the same results. <br />
<br />
I 'll contact my provider, to see if there were any changes on the server.<br />
<br />
I just recently installed Atutor and Acontent, so it would not be too much trouble to install everything again. But I would like to know what happened. <br />
I'll let you know if I know anything.<br />
<br />
Also: I didn't dug too deeply yet into the programs, but from what I've seen sofar, both ATutor and AContent look excellent! <br />
kind regards,<br />
Ivo</p>

				<p>--solved---<br />
<br />
problem was: I was over my disk usage limit on the server.<br />
<br />
Everything works again!<br />
Thanks,<br />
