I've created a couple default accounts, which you'll probably want to change.<br />
<br />
admin:admin<br />
instructor:instructor<br />
<br />
You should now change your db access info. Posting it to a public forum is risky. Others will likely be monitoring, and even though I've delete that info from your message, subscribers would have received it by email. In the future send this type of info through the Contact Us form.<br />
<br />
PS. Are you able to get rid of that advertising bar?</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>I am running Apache 2, PHP 43.34, and MySQL 4.0.18 (?) and I had the same problem and found another solution to the problem. I've had Apache running for a while on my server. I installed PHP and MySQL and knew that both PHP and MySQL were working fine.<br />
<br />
My problem was the entire install worked completely fine, but at the end when I was directed to login I only received the DocType, head, body, /body, and /head tags in the HTML document. Everything else was blank. After two days, I figured out the problem.<br />
<br />
PHP 4 does not automatically install the php4_session module which seems to be required to make ATutor work correctly.<br />
<br />
I did one other thing that may or may not have anything to do with getting ATutor to work. I added AcceptPathInfo On to my httpd.conf file.<br />
<br />
I know ATutor isn't supposed to work on Apache 2, but I don't have a production server and just wanted to try it out. --Al</p>
