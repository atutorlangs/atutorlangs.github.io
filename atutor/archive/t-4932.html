				<p>Greetings. I successfully (I think) set up ATutor on my home computer (XP, Apache1.3, PHP4)<br />
<br />
Elated with my success, I tried in on my web site (Linux Shared hosting).  Appears to work, though slowly. My hosting company has the following guidelines for CGI programs:<br />
<br />
>>"Please optimize your scripts relative to memory usage and CPU time. Our system automatically stops scripts that use too many system resources."<br />
<br />
>>Programming Limits:<br />
>>CPU : 6 seconds @ 100%<br />
>>Memory : 10240KB (10MB)<br />
>>Numerical Processes : 12"<br />
<br />
Are there any php scripts which might exceed the 6 second limit? <br />
<br />
I had problems connecting with mysql on my XP box:  one script timed out at 30 seconds. No problem on the linux share host however.</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>Your host specifies CPU : 6 seconds @ 100%, which is different from actually taking up that much time. A script could take 30 seconds while only actually using half that time with the CPU.<br />
<br />
Some scripts require considerably longer than 30seconds to complete (such as uploading files or sending out email).<br />
<br />
Your host has set those limitations to make it impossible from a single client from hogging all the resources. Although ATutor can function in a shared hosting environment, these restrictions would probably not allow it to use enough resources needed to conduct real courses online.</p>
