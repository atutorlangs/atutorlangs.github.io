				<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Browsing the forums tells me you guys ain't big fans of SCORM, only trouble is here in Blighty they're still SCORM DAFT (some links to qualified reasoning for the switch to CC would be great, so I can throw some stones at some glass houses!!) Anyway, enough of my rantings! I enabled the SCORM Packages Module, where oh where is the link to upload my zip file/s?? Anything else I got to do?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance (again!)</p>

				<p>Be sure its enabled, firstly, on the Module manager main page. When enabled a link will appear for instructors under the Manage tab "Packages." Turn it on as a Course Tool to make the uploaded packages available to students.<br />
<br />
No links specifically for CC over SCORM, but if you search for the terms together, you'll get lots of opinions. Flexibility is the main advantage of CC.</p>

				<p>Aye, at Atutor/mods/_core/modules/index.php I have enabled the SCORM doo dah thingy (linux term!)<br />
<br />
However, I don't see a "Manage" tab for me to get anywhere near a link to upload a zip file. When I do get there, hoping to see a CC upload field too! <br />
<br />
I fell at the first hurdle, picked myself up then fell at the second.... third time lucky eh?<br />
<br />
See attachment, nothing remotely resembling a "Manage" tab.</p>

				<p>The Manage tab is an instructor feature. You need to login to a course as its instructor to see it.<br />

Look under the Content tools and Import/Export to find CC</p>

				<p>Ah ha, so in "the boss" mode you don't see everything??? <br />
Where do I look for more gotchas like that? <br />
<br />
You say I gotta "login to a course as its instructor" to see it. Eh there is no course, it's a course I want to upload through as a SCORM package(initially, then I'll go for CC after my stone throwing!)<br />
<br />
And ammunition/references to throw stones at the SCORM lovers here in Blighty would be greatly apprieciated?</p>

				<p>I'm not sure I'd call it a gotcha. It pretty normal for systems to have an admin area.<br />
<br />
If there's no course, you'd need to create one. Click Create Course on the My Start Page, or for an Admin Courses>Create Course.<br />
<br />
Rather than me repeating what's in the documentation, read through the handbook, linked in the footer of ATutor.</p>

				<p>Fair enough Greg, I have read through the documentation (well sort of...you know what it's like?... I hope!) off to read now, still surprised that I don't see any way as being "THE BOSS" when I go to Admin Courses>Create Course and given no option to upload scorm or cc zip file. <br />
<br />
When I go there I create the course as "admin" my user with the "instructor" role and still no option to upload a zip file in any format whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Time to leave it and come back to it in the morning! A dollar says it's something simple!<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time Greg,<br />

				<p>Ah ha!<br />
<br />
So first I had to create a course before the "manage" tab magically appeared. So now I got to install JRE is it still the case that I have to install version 1.5?<br />
<br />
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase5-419410.html#jre-1.5.0_22-oth-JPR <br />
<br />
tells me there are a million and one different offerings<br />
Java SE Runtime Environment 5.0u22 seems to be the last of the line, is that the one I should go for?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>

				<p>Hi Greg,<br />
<br />
Wish I had known that 24 hours ago, lol! Anything specific I should do to make ATutor aware of the new environment? (read the manual perhaps?)<br />
