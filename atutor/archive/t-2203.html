				<p>I edited config.inc.php	to change the course name and re uploaded it. But I did it in Wordpad which added \par and \tab tags mostly to ends of lines. Atutor asked me to install ... I didnt.<br />
<br />
I recopied config.inc.php into a proper editor, deleted the tags and also stuff in the first lines about being an rtf file! so it had the standard php start line.<br />

However now I get<br />

				<p>Had another go this morning after hours at it last night.<br />
Assumed the odd } bracket in the error message was in the config file somewhere it shouldn't be and of course it was. It had got stuck on the bottom line. I carefully checked other php files to see if they had { brackets on the bottom as I thought they didn't, and yes they didn't. So deleted it.<br />
<br />
That then put me back to being told it wasn't installed!<br />
<br />
Double checked again nothing!	<br />
My direct onsite editing still not working so I'd uploaded by ftp renamed file & done permissions.<br />
Found I'd named the poor thing config,inc,php ... so the comma before the php ending was the culprit.<br />
<br />
Thought I'd write this in so new folk even less novice than I am with php can see how this can happen.</p>

				<p>ATutor files need to be edited in a plain text editor. Other editors have a high probability of breaking scripts because they often add their own non text characters. The most common problem is editors that add an invisible character at the end of a file, which inevitably breaks the script, and is often difficult to discover unless you know what you're looking for. <br />
<br />
Always delete any spaces that may get inserted by an editor follow the closing ?> of a modified php script.</p>
