				<p>Hi, I'm planning to implement ATutor for a highschool institution. I have made the test and everything seems to work fine. Now, I have a question because maybe I will need to implement more sites for other institutions. I have a server when I host my sites and I want to know how to calculate how much ram and processor do I need to host some Atutors sites... I'm guessing that the minimum students per ATutor installation is 300 and the maximun students on a ATutor installation could be 6000<br />
<br />
So, If I want to have about 7 ATutors on a server, what do I need ? how much RAM? how much processor? I understand that the disk space and bandwith is relative... but I want to know how to calculate this values (ram, processor, disk, bandwith, etc) depending on the number of students (?) or courses (?)<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot !</p>

				<p>Now-a-days with low end machines starting with dual core processors,  2 gig or ram, and 250 gig of disk space, even a low end machine will manage what you have described. <br />
<br />
If all installation had 6000 user (42,000). I'd go for something a little more powerful than a lowest end machine to handle traffic during peak times, such as the start of a semester, or exam time. <br />
<br />
We have a 5000 user system running on an old P2, and it barely registers a load.<br />
<br />
What is more beneficial is a fast internet connection.</p>

				<p>Hi greg ! Thanks for your answer :)<br />
<br />
It will helps me to take a decition... I understand that those values are based on your experience, but is it possible to get any formula or something like that ? to make any estimation in the future.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot, and thanks for ATutor.</p>

				<p>There is not a set formula for calculating hardware requirements.<br />
<br />
The thing to keep in mind when talking about hardware requirements is simultaneous connections. Even with 10,000 or more students on a system, you would rarely get more than a hundred connecting at the same time. Even if half of all these students are logged in, only a small percentage will be connecting at the same time, clicking a link or a button etc. It takes many more simultaneous connections to overload a system. Typically loads are heavy at the beginning of a semester on large installations. Even with all the students you're suggesting logged in, I would not foresee any significant load issues on low to medium end current technology.</p>
