				<p>I just installed the new ATutor 1.3.2 and it all went well, tables installedall permissions ok I get to the finish page with the login link, I click the login and it comes back and gives me the install page again:<br />

ATutor does not appear to be installed. Continue on to the installation.<br />

I have checked the database and all tables are installed.  No error messages, just can't get out of the install loop.</p>

				<p>What does the index or login file look for to determine if ATutor is installed or not. <br />

I notice there is a conditional at the very end of the config file that has something to do with the install.  I tried setting it to true but it didn't have an effect.<br />

 I seem to remember having this problem on another installation but not sure how it was resolved.</p>

I have checked the database with phpMyAdmin and it is totally populated, and given the database login info requested during installation.  I also checked the config file and it has the appropriate db login info.</p>

				<p>This would indicate that the db info is not correct, but you should not have been able to get through the install if that was the case. <br />

Do you have root access, or is this a hosted system? Show the problem to your ISP if its hosted. Perhaps your MySQL account is not configured properly. Perhaps a firewall...<br />

Post here an exact copy of any errors or messages you receive.</p>

				<p>the exact error on the login page now is:<br />

"Unable to connect to db."<br />
<br />
I just took a good look into the database that was set up during installation.  It contains 30 tables and has the instructor account I entered during setup. <br />
<br />
I am on a hosted server but I have close to 50 databases on it, and have never had a problem creating databases, adding deleting or editing tables etc on 100 or more scripts that access them.  When I have a db connect error I can usually track it down to a typo in the config file.  This is not the case here as the connect info did in fact set up the tables properly.<br />
<br />
I do remember a similar problem with an earlier version of ATutor, but cannot recall what combination of late night jiggling cured the problem.  This time I'll take notes ;-)</p>

				<p>Wierder still,  I just installed the latest release of ATutor on an entirely different server and have the same install loop problem.<br />
<br />
Database tables get installed fine, Admin and user accounts get set up, but when I click the login link on the last page of the install script, it sends me to the not installed error page with a link to start the installation.<br />
<br />
I am starting to think I am just not destined to use this great script.  Any other ideas what could be going on?  I will send you the phpinfo page url for this second server by email.</p>

				<p>There is a parse error in your config.inc.php file.<br />
<br />
Check to make sure that you don't have any single quotes (') or double quotes (") that are not escaped (/').<br />
<br />
if you have a quote in your db password then you will end up with something like:<br />
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'my'spass');<br />
<br />
which will result in a parse error since the first single quote is not escaped.<br />
<br />
( i was just using "DB_PASSWORD" as an example, it could be the problem with any of the options, so double check them all).<br />
