			<div class="body">
				<p>1. I created File Storage for ALL Students.<br />
2. Uploaded text file to COURSE FILES as Instructor.<br />
3. Students upload Assignment Files, HAND IN, and SUBMIT.<br />
4. Instructor can read Assignment Files. Instructor writes comments on individual student files.<br />
5. Students cannot read comments; unable to receive Instructor comments.<br />
<br />
I checked with my Internet host and we both logged in as student and instructor. He said it's not a download issue, he says it has something to do with permissions.<br />
<br />
I'm sending videos I made of how I do it so you can see. I might be missing a step?<br />
<br />
I have a lot of courses to grade so I need to make the file storage work.<br />
<br />
Where did the Instructor Comments go? I need the comments to be accessed by the students. Please help me figure this out. I will sign up for Basic Support if needed. It's very important. Thank you!<br />
<br />
If it's easier to just delete or uninstall file storage and start fresh, please advise. Thanks.<br />

				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Just a quick note, I have attached a screenshot.  I think you should tell the student to switch to the assignment workspace in order to see your comments.</p>

				<p>This is a known issue in 1.6.1. It's fixed in the later versions of ATutor. So you may want to upgrade your ATutor. We also created a new module "Assignment Dropbox" for ATutor 2.0+, the one mentioned in Harris' reply, which would simplify the assignment submission a lot. Once you upgrade, you can find it @ admin -> modules -> install modules.</p>

				<p>Do you mean that you need our help to install the new systems? If so, do you have available service ticket?<br />
<br />
BTW, you can upgrade your current ATutor instead of installing a totally new.</p>
