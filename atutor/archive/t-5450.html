				<p>Yes i have.<br />
I can get the install to work correctly.<br />
Some system changes have to be made if you have a server with mysql on it already.<br />
Along with some php changes if you used the php windows installer as im useing windows.<br />
Also the php.ini file needs to be changed and a few other files to set things correctly.<br />
But after those minor inconviences you can indeed get it to install to the mysql local dweb database server.<br />
Php will work also<br />
The problem that occurs is with Atutor.<br />
The links are all messed up once its installed.<br />
So the log in page doesnt show up correctly and none of the links will work on that login page.<br />
After i go into vitals and config.in php to see whats going on i see that near everything looks correct and i can not identify why the setup does not work correctly.<br />
Dweb uses a version of apache 1.3 something.<br />
In any event im looking into see if anyone else has tried this and got it to work. Maybe i can get some information on exactly what the problems are as i can not identify them myself.</p>
