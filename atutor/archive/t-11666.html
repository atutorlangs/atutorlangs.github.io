				<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I think this is possible but I just want to clear something up before I buy and was hoping somebody could clear it up...<br />
<br />
-I have a membership site and I want to have a teacher get their own individual "classroom" group when they join.<br />
<br />
-From there, the students would sign up into that teacher's room.<br />
<br />
-There would then be homework and assignments to be completed on a daily basis by the students.<br />
<br />
-The teacher could then download a checklist at the end of the week to see who's been doing their work and who's been slacking off (maybe the attendance feature)?<br />
<br />
-Finally, the teacher could then click on a student's name to go deeper and actually see the work that they've been doing.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd like to remove almost all the other features except for those above so things are as simple as possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
All the best,<br />
Mike</p>
