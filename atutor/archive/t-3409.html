				<p>I am using the demo "Play Here Course" to get to know ATutor. I uploaded an image called "graph.gif" to the "images" folder in the file manager. I then created a test called "Manipulating Percentages" and added the graph image to the test by writing in the body of a question: &lt;img src="images/graph.gif" height="324" width="410" alt="In 1989, the employees commission totaled $1000. In 1990, it increased to $2000. In 1991, it increased again, to $3000 dollars. In 1992, the employees commission decreased to $2000, and, in 1993, it decreased to $1000."><br />
<br />
My problem is that the image does not show up when I preview the test. There is a gray box that has the correct proportions, but the image is not there. I viewed it from both the student's and the instructor's perspective, and neither one works. I have also tried viewing it in both Internet Explorer and Mozilla. Why can't I see this image??<br />

Thanks!</p>
