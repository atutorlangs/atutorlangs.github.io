<br />
A year ago I didn't have that problem.<br />
<br />
Does the links has an expiration or something like that? What can be wrong with the database?<br />

Thanks a lot<br />

				<p>It's difficult to say what the problem is. You are using a fairly old version of ATutor, and a third party theme. It could be something has changed on the server that is causing the problem.<br />
<br />
If there's an opportunity, I would suggest upgrading. Note however that the Corporate theme is no longer available in the current version of ATutor.<br />
<br />
There is no expiration associated with auto-enroll.</p>

				<p>Hi Greg, thanks for your answer.<br />
<br />
The problem is that we don't have time to upgrade and replace theme, check things, etc. It is a hard long work and the people are not ready to do that (they will not pay me the work).<br />
<br />
Getting back in the issue, if that was working before what could be wrong now?<br />
<br />
Is there a way that you tell me what tables are affected when a new user is created? Maybe I can create a script that makes the work directly to the database.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot !</p>

				<p>We see this type of problem occur occasionally  when systems are upgraded. ATutor 1.6.3 was created before PHP 5.2.11, so it is possible something changed in PHP that's causing the problem. Which means upgrading may be your best solution to the problem. More effort may go into figuring out what's causing the problem, than it would take to do an upgrade.<br />
<br />
Upgrades are not difficult, though recreating the theme will need some effort. Perhaps one of the themes for ATutor 2 will be a sufficient replacement.<br />
<br />
http://atutor.ca/atutor/docs/installation.php#upgrade<br />
<br />
Sorry we can't help more. This is the type of problem that could take a lot of time to investigate. <br />
<br />
If you want to investigate yourself, its the "members" table new accounts get added to.<br />
<br />
Also try using the default them when creating a user, to see if it Corporate theme is the problem.</p>

				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have made 1.6.3 -> 1.6.4 whit all patches = Problem not solved,<br />
then 1.6.4 -> 2.0 eith all patches (except Patch 03) = Problem not solved.<br />
<br />
I'm still getting "The student ID and PIN combination you provided is either being used or is incorrect."<br />
<br />
If I continue updating I guess tha I'll receive the same errorr message. Seems that the upgrading is not helping.<br />
<br />
<br />
Version 2.0 has been released on July 6 2010 and PHP 5.2.11 on 16-September-2009<br />
<br />
Any other idea?</p>

				<p>ID and PIN are not the same as user/password. <br />
This is a System Preference, "authenticate against master list" Turn off the preference and the problem should go away.<br />
<br />
Try to be as exact as possible when you're describing problems you might be having.</p>

				<p>Hi Greg, thanks for your patience and forgive me to not be clear.<br />

The problem yes, has been solved and seems that somebody turn on that option and I didn't know it.<br />

Thanks a lot, by the way this was an opportunity to me to rediscover ATutor, great software !</p>
