				<p>i installed atutor on my own site, which is on a linux server and i installed it on the server mentioned below. then i installed photo album in both applications.<br />
on the linux server it works alright<br />
on the other there's a problem;<br />
it seems to be installed but is displayed like this<br />
[photo album] and the possibilities to upload pictures are not there. If i have a look at the mysql file the table language_text is mentioned but not at_language_text. So there must be something wrong with the mysql file or something else is the matter.<br />
Bit strange because the same atutor version and photo album versions are used. <br />
My question: what's the solution? Who can help me in this?<br />
<br />
<br />
operating system  - windows nt 5.2<br />
version of ATutor - 1.6<br />
versions of php -  5.2.5<br />
version of mysql - 5.0.51a<br />
webserver & version - apache 2.2.8<br />
your ATutor location- http://83.247.63.27/atutor</p>

				<p>There should be no difference between Linux and windows installs. If you are planning to use it in a production environment, Linux is definetly the way to go. Windows has never been a very satable environment for PHP applications. <br />
<br />
I would just suggest trying to install the module again.</p>
