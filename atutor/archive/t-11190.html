				<p>First of all, thanks to the developer of the ecomm module and greg. I wouldn't have worked on this if I haven't got inspiration from them.<br />
<br />
This is a Full Fledged E-Commerce module which can be used for a variety of purposes. As I am still improving it, I'm releasing it for BETA testing. As of now, the following is the feature list:<br />
[b]<br />
Courses now have a validity - Right from One Week validity to a One Year Validity - a total of 7 options - DONE<br />
Multiple Cost Association using Ajax - Separate fields for entering costs for a One Week Course, Two Weeks Course and so on up to One Year Course - DONE<br />
Instructor can create Course Combos - Offer discounted packages to students if they want to buy more than one course - DONE<br />
The user will be given an option to enter the validity dates for different courses incase of a Combo Course - DONE<br />
After the validity date is over, the student is unenrolled automatically - DONE<br />
The user will be able to pay the money over PayPal IPN - DONE<br />
Administrator interface for a confiduring the mod - DONE<br />
Multi Language Support - Almost Done<br />
Multiple Payment System - As of now, PayPal is supported provided you have a Business Account. I've tested using Sandbox Environment<br />
Documentation - PENDING<br />
User will be displayed even the minute information about his course - Course Start Date, Course End Date etc. - DONE - For this, you will have to replace the original index.tmpl.php file in the themes\default\users directory with the one i provided in the rar file. This is very important for the proper functioning of the mod!<br />
Email notifications - PENDING<br />

				<p>Patience.  We do keep a full schedule. Thngs like this take time to get to. Expect a week or two at least before an ATutor staff person can look at it.<br />
<br />
Continue with your development, and post an update as the module becomes more stable. You're more likely to get someone to test the module if its complete, or close to it.</p>

				<p>I wasn't talking about the developers or staff at all. I know how tight your schedules would be. I was intending soemone from the user base to help me test this out. Anyways, I'll wait... The only reason why I was asking is that I wanted know if anyone is interested in such a mod.. thats all :) I'm sorry if I offended anyone...</p>

				<p>No offense taken. Still, it might take a while for ATutor users to reply.  <br />

Will will take a look at your work ourselves when we can. We're in the middle of preparing for a release, so there's other priorities at the moment.</p>
