				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I can't seem to reproduce the problem that you encountered.  I do get a notification email when a student tried to enroll a private course.  You may try referring to the documentation and make sure the preferences of the course are set correctly.</p>

				<p>hi,<br />
<br />
I cannot log into your site unless you provide us with your server detailed information through our Services: http://www.atutor.ca/services/.<br />
<br />
However, it seems to be a mail server problem from what you've described to me.  I am not getting any of those errors on my local server or on the atutor.ca's demo.<br />
<br />
You may want to check with your mail service provider.</p>

				<p>Thank you Harris,<br />
<br />
 I checked with mail service provider they conformed that sendmail is working properly and there is no problem with it.<br />
<br />
Another thing i found is when I am trying to recover forgotten password then also it shows error as follows:<br />
"There was error sending the email message"<br />
<br />
Can you please guide me what all things needs to be checked to verify that there is no problem with the Atutor while sending the email on registration and also while recovering password . (I mean which php files should i check and verify)<br />
<br />
Thank you</p>
