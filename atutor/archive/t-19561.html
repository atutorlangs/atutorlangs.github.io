				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I am just starting to create some courses. The interface is somewhat confusing to me. If you could answer a couple of questions, I would appreciate it.<br />
<br />
1. What is the difference between creating a course as an instructor and as the administrator?<br />
2. Once I have created a course as an instructor, how can I go back and edit the various aspects of it, such as the banner? I don't see any place to do this.<br />
3. When I first created a new course, I selected for the Create Basic Announcement, content and forum. However no forum is displayed when I look at that course afterwards. How do I add a forum to a course once it has been created?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Robert</p>

				<p>I think you should spend a few hours playing with ATutor's interface and tools. It's quite simple -- in fact, simpler than, for example, Moodle's.<br />
<br />
1. When creating a course -- no difference, except that an admin can specify a few advanced features, e.g. the disk quota. In both cases, you'll need to log in as an instructor in order to create content and use that course.<br />
<br />
2. It's Manage -> Properties.<br />
<br />
3. It should be under Forums icon on the course home page, and Forums tab.</p>

				<p>That is extremely helpful. Thanks again!<br />
I hadn't explored the Manage section yet. I see a lot is there.<br />
<br />
Just a note, I was able to successfully embed a video In my first test course that I uploaded to Amazon AWS Cloudfront. Worked like a charm!<br />

				<p>Glad it helped.<br />
Chances are, you'll spend most of the time as an instructor on Manage tab.</p>
