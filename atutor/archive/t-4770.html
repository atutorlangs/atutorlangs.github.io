				<p>operating system - Linux<br />
  version of ATutor - 1.4.3<br />
  versions of php - 4.3.8<br />
  version of mysq l - 3.23.56<br />
  webserver & version - Apache 1.3<br />
<br />
I tried different LCMS and I decided to suggest to the organizatin I work for, the use of ATutor for a lot of reason we all, the followers of this project, know.<br />
<br />
So I installed an ATutor copy to test it with on real condition with the stress of several intructors, assitants and of course students. <br />
<br />
I created 2-3 courses with not much information and 1 with almost full use of the system (not test or quizzes).  I works fine except tha I can`t make a single backup of this particular last course I mentioned neither export the contents of it. Although I can make it with the others smaller content courses, so I figure is not a backup or export script issue.<br />
<br />
The whole DB is less than 5Mb, not much isn't it? But I always get blank page or browser quit answer for a long period of trying.<br />
I even tried to manually backup the database through PhpMyAdmin ...and the browser also quits with a blank page.<br />
<br />
I even thought, could be a sigle quoute or double bad escaping bug on the content uploading scripts, have you eexperienced something similar?<br />
Any suggestion?<br />
<br />
And last but not least, congratulations for such wonderful project and results.</p>

				<p>Check your size limit settings both in php.ini (upload_max_filesize, post_max_size), and properties associated with a course. <br />
<br />
It might be special characters casuing the problem. There were early reports of such problems. These have been fixed in 1.5, if you want to try it instead.</p>

				<p>Actually the course quota is 10Mb and the course properties page reports just 8Mb for this particular course.<br />
So I think it must be something with special characters, I will upgrade of course but not now, cause I don't want to deal with the risk of another mess in the middle of the course.<br />
I could replicate the entire atutor system and do the upgrade there, but that's the long road for something that is already fixed.<br />
So I'll follow the rule "if it works, don't touch it" until the course ends.<br />
Anyway I apreciate very much your help, and I let you know later if everything goes right.</p>
