				<p>Does the language pack have to be unzipped? I tried it both ways. I have not tried turning on the translation as I am going to have to think through the process. <br />
<br />
For some reason, it will not import through the tool, (all I get is a browse button that goes to local files), so I downloaded it. Will do some more checking.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

				<p>Ok, it worked today. It would not update online, I had tried to use the downloaded pack earlier. On the chance that the download had gotten corrupted, I deleted it and redownloaded the file. <br />

Worked!<br />
