				<p>Hello Greg and all,<br />
I have always been much interested in e-learning. I also happen to be a Software developer. I'd like to participate in this project. I'have been investigating some of the open source e-learning plat-forms and I think yours is the most promissing. My only concern is how well documented is your code? is it easy to get started with revewing the architecture and adding features and add-ons? I have been browsing your web-site searching for this type of info with little success. I hope you can direct me to the proper docs. Maybe is the needed documentation included with the downloads?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, and good luck.<br />

				<p>We are planning to set up a CVS in the near future. A programmers manual will be created at that time.<br />
<br />
Getting involved now would require studying the code. If you have particular ideas for features or enhancement for ATutor, let us know and we will see what we can do to help you get started.<br />
