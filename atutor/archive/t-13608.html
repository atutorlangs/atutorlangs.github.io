				<p>Hello there. I have been testing your software and I want to use it so that the content has all the course in it. However, when taking a test, a student may return to the content and take the exam from the start, even though the number of attempts is set to 1, which could lead to cheating. Is there any way to avoid all possible links to content when taking a test? Or to avoid viewing any page until the test is submitted?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</p>

				<p>Testing online is a risky business if tests are not invigilate. Even if the content was not accessible while a test was running, a student could open a different browser and view the content through it.<br />
<br />
It would not be too difficult to disable access to content, that would only discourage the honest students.There'd be some programming involved.</p>
