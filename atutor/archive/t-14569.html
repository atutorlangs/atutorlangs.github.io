				<p>I am planning to start using ATutor as our LCM I am trying to decide on a hosting company - we currently use Host Gator for our regular sites and they seem to have the capacity for this software. But I noticed that your site has SiteGround as the recommended host. Is there something specific I should look for when selecting a hosting company to run the ATutor software?<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any recommendations or suggestions? If I do not use SiteGround will you install the software for me if I purchase a support package??<br />
<br />
What are the downsides of running this software on a host other than the ones listed on your home page?</p>

				<p>These days most providers have the requirements to run ATutor. We don't endorse any provider in particular, we've just had a few happy customers report back on their experience with SiteGround, not to say that other providers don't provide the same level of service. And SiteGround does provide free installation, which draws many people to them.<br />
<br />
If you do decide to go with another provider, we can potentially do the installation for you, if the provider doesn't provide that service. A one time Installation and Troubleshooting ticket is what you'd need.<br />
<br />
There is no downside to running on other hosts that we might identify. The list just happens to be those who have reported their service, or that we have come across while on the Web.</p>

				<p>I believe you should also check that the site you choose has PHP safe mode turned OFF.<br />
Strange enough, but some providers do have it on, rendering some ATutor tools unusable.</p>
