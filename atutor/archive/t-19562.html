				<p>Just to share with others. When I uploaded the .tar.gz installation file and uncompressed it on the server, it created a new folder called ATutor and unzipped all the files there. I actually wanted the files to go into the root folder, not a subfolder. <br />
<br />
I had success using the 7Zip compression/decompression package (free open source). It unzipped all the installation files on my home computer. I then uploaded all the files using FTP. All worked well.<br />

				<p>Unzipping into an ATutor directory is on purpose. If you were to unzip everything onto a directory with other files without the ATutor top level directory, I'd make an awful mess. Just unzip the ATutor bundle one directory level up, then move the root directory out of the way, and rename the ATutor directory to whatever the root was.<br />
<br />
Uploading ATutor files by FTP is risky. More often than not, files get corrupted in the transfer. You may not notice problems right away, but if you do start getting error messages, FTPing is very likely the source of the problem.</p>
