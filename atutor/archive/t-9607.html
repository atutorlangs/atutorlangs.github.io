				<p>Hey All,<br />
<br />
Our course is structured on a week to week basis, called problem based learning (PBL). Each week the learning is based upon a different medical scenario/problem. <br />
<br />
Is it possible to have a structure similar to Moodle, where all activities for that week are listed chronologically? Rather than having all activities broken down into categories (forum, tests, content, links). <br />
<br />
Although I like the extra functionability of Atutor, the GUI is counter intuitive for our type of course. <br />
<br />
I would love to hear if this is possible in atutor.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

				<p>I'd suggest creating a weekly summary page, and copying links to the activities for the week to that page.</p>

				<p>I have decided not to go with Atutor and with Moodle instead.<br />
<br />
Even though Atutor has more features, the course/GUI layout in Atutor is confusing. Creating a summary page and copy-pasting links is a lot of extra work and this really should be done by the software. <br />
<br />
I would love to see the different course types available in Moodle (weekly based, topic based, etc, etc) incorporated in Atutor.<br />
<br />
Best Wishes,<br />

				<p>Sorry to hear that. <br />
<br />
Moodle follows specific learning scenarios, where ATutor has been created to be adaptable to any learning scenario. Usually its just a matter of applying a little creativity. Creating weekly lessons, could be done by simply creating  Week 1, Week 2 ... content sections.</p>
