				<p>Running<br />
 version of ATutor - 1.5.2<br />
  web browser being used - IE5+<br />
Was able to import one of the SCORM packages you have to sample.<br />
When I go into Packages, I can see the package fine, and actually go through it. But I am unable to bring it out onto the Courses page.<br />
The documentation says I should go into [Settings] to "turn it on". <br />
My choices look like this in Packages . . .<br />
Back To: Manage | Packages | Import Package | Delete Package | [ ] <br />
When I mouseover that last item [_] I get indications in the status bar that I should be able to go to Settings.php. When I click on the phantom link, the page goes empty.<br />

Thanks for any help.  Jack Fulkerson<br />

				<p>I'm not sure what you mean by "bring it out into a course page"<br />
<br />
Packages (SCORM SCOs) run in their own environment, and don't become a part of the ATutor content. That said however, it is possible to import the content of a SCO, though not the sequencing, into an ATutor content page using the Import feature in the content tools.<br />
<br />
If you mean "how do you make a package available to students", then you need to turn on packages under Manage>>Student Tools.<br />
<br />
The Settings feature was disabled in the current version of the SCORM module, and should not be appearing as a "phantom" link. Ignore it. The Settings features will be brought back in a future version when we've had a chance to improve on it.</p>
