				<p>Hi.  I have 2.0 installed and I just received two emails today that basically look like this....<br />

[quote][url=http://www-retirementcommunity.com]provillus at walmart[/url] Web 2.0 is simply a marketing strategy using one or many of the social media outlets. Those outlets are broken down into 6 different types:<br />
The Facebook fan page can look very similar to your personal Facebook profile page, or you can choose to have it look more like a 'real' website - but within the Facebook interface. On a standard Fanpage, you can basically post pictures and text info about your business.<br />

So, clearly this is spam, but I can't find the user that sent it.  There is no account with the "From" email address in the system.  <br />
<br />
How could this have happened?  Could other users have gotten this?  How can this be prevented in the future?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

				<p>This probably came from the contact instructor link in the Browse Courses list. No others should have received it. If it becomes a real problem you could manually remove the contact instructor link by editing it out of the browse courses theme template, though if its just the occasional spam, it may be worth just ignoring them. I suppose it depends on how important allowing potential students to contact a course instructor is.</p>
