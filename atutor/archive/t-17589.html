				<p>The test are there and I can get the results and export them. I however need to export all the answers given by all the students so I can sort them and see where the weak areas are. I can get the general stats as well where I can list the open ended answers but this also does not help as I then do not know who the answers belong too or who needs extra attention.<br />
<br />
I am very sorry but as much as I look in the handbook and try options I just cannot seem to find out how to export the answer sheets.<br />
<br />
I have tried doing this from my Instructors manage options - Test & Surveys and I have also tried going into the normal option from the test and Surveys where you would normally see your test and take it. I then see the two blocks "Test & Surveys" and below it "Your Submission" and this is the test that I took as an Instructor. I can view my test paper but also am unable to export it. However as I view my paper here I need to view all the students and export them all as a complete paper</p>

				<p>I'm not really clear on what you are trying to do. The submissions and statistics under Manage>Tests & Surveys is where all the functionality associated with test results can be found. If there's something you're trying to do, but can't find the feature to do it, its probably not there. In most cases you can adapt from what is there.<br />
<br />
The data is just that. You can not export the what you've called the answer sheet (unless you want to print them off one-by-one). You would import the data into a spreadsheet for instance, then work with it from there. Add names in place of id numbers. Those you can found by exporting the class list.<br />
<br />
Please experiment.</p>

				<p>Lets say I have three students <br />
A, B and C. I have a number of open ended questions. So once the three have completed the test I need to analyse the answers to determine what the responses were to the open ended questions. I also need to run queries on the other questions and answers to find out where the weak areas are. Now with just three students I can manually do this without exporting the complete answers sheets. However with a lot of students I have no way for determining what the actual results are of the test other other than the grade marks?<br />
<br />
As I am able to view the results of my own test once completed I need to be able to view all students test and then export them. So this would be exporting each question and answer of each student. I can then run Excel queries on the results <br />
<br />
I have experimented but I must say I am not finding the navigation around this apps very easy and I have set up the server and the forum software I am using.</p>

				<p>Ok I have made screen captures of what I see.<br />
<br />
As an Instructor I go to manage http://s103.photobucket.com/albums/m125/Triumphtalk/?action=view&current=aTutor_12Jun101449.jpg<br />
<br />
I scroll down to the bottom of this page and select Tests & Surveys http://s103.photobucket.com/albums/m125/Triumphtalk/?action=view&current=aTutor_13Jun101449.jpg<br />
<br />
I then select the test I want to view http://s103.photobucket.com/albums/m125/Triumphtalk/?action=view&current=aTutor_14Jun101450.jpg<br />
<br />
 now select submissions http://s103.photobucket.com/albums/m125/Triumphtalk/?action=view&current=aTutor_15Jun101450.jpg<br />
<br />
I now get a list of all my students that have completed the test http://s103.photobucket.com/albums/m125/Triumphtalk/?action=view&current=aTutor_16Jun101450.jpg<br />
<br />
I tick the box next to the student I want to view and go to the bottom and select view and mark test http://s103.photobucket.com/albums/m125/Triumphtalk/?action=view&current=aTutor_17Jun101451.jpg<br />
<br />
I then see the complete test paper with all the questions and what answers the student has given http://s103.photobucket.com/albums/m125/Triumphtalk/?action=view&current=aTutor_18Jun101451.jpg<br />
<br />
I have a save and cancel option here no export http://s103.photobucket.com/albums/m125/Triumphtalk/?action=view&current=aTutor_18Jun101451.jpg<br />
<br />
(Ok now I need to export this to a csv file but I don't want to do each one one at a time but all of the students at once. So now I would have the completed question papers in a file of all students)<br />
<br />
If I however had of selected statistics instead of submissions here http://s103.photobucket.com/albums/m125/Triumphtalk/?action=view&current=aTutor_20Jun101452.jpg<br />
<br />
I would then get a stats list with all the questions and then the possible answers nest to the question and how many students selected what answers http://s103.photobucket.com/albums/m125/Triumphtalk/?action=view&current=aTutor_21Jun101452.jpg<br />
<br />
If it was an open ended question I can click on view responses and see what responses were given, however I do not know what student said what here http://s103.photobucket.com/albums/m125/Triumphtalk/?action=view&current=aTutor_22Jun101452.jpg<br />
<br />
Once again I do not see any place to export this info</p>

				<p>Ah now we are getting somewhere. I changed the theme and I now see what you have attached harris. The only problem with this csv export the open ended questions just have a 0 for the 0 marks allocated to it. Now I can also see the open ended questions by looking at Question Stats and viewing the responses. However this way is a bit difficult to pin it against the students name also for manipulation purposes it would be better to have these responses in the csv file? Also when sending the file to the manager of that department would exclude the open ended responses <br />

Thanks guys for sticking with me on this one</p>
