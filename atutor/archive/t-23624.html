				<p>I have not looked into this, because I don't want to use Flash. The reason being that Flash does not work in iPad and iPhone, which doesn't support Flash.<br />
<br />
That being said, I am inclided to *think* that the most correct thing to say is that there is a bug in ATutor.  And my suspicision is that it is a byte serving bug:<br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_serving<br />
<br />
The reason why I asked about Safari was because Safari is basically incompatible with ATutor when it comes to serving audio and video *without* Flash.  Other browsers than Safari does not require byte serving - at least ont the way Safari requires it - so they don't have problems.<br />
<br />
As for ATutor plus Flash, then I don't know if the byte serving issue is the problem. May be I am just too preoccupied with "byte serving" so that I see byte serving problems everywhere. But nevertheless, my suspicision is that this *is* the reason for your problem.<br />
<br />
The Apache Web server handles byte serving, aparently. But when files are served via PHP, as is the case with ATtutor, then the byte serving side of things needs to be implemented in PHP.<br />
<br />
I have reported a bug about this: http://atutor.ca/view/3/23505/1.html<br />
(But note that I did  not know what "byte serving" was when I filed that bug, so, as you can see, that bug started out as something completely different.)</p>

				<p>Flash swf files should work fine with IE 9. My guess is the flash player plugin has not been setup for IE 9. Try reinstalling or updating the flash player on your system.</p>

				<p>Thank you for your help Greg. I have tried to get this going in IE9 - re-installed latest Flash, followed Microsoft's suggestions for problems with swf in IE9 (settings) - but no good so far. I have tried it using both 64 bit and 32 bit Windows 7 on two different computers. It works on an older computer of mine (XP and using IE8).<br />

Maybe I will ask Microsoft?<br />

				<p>1) But do you know if VM interacts, in any way, with Windows7? May be it "borrow" some media handling from the Mac OS?<br />
<br />
2) The two of you really needs to test each others installations to see. It might be that it works in some installation, but not in another. So I suggest that you start inviting each others ATutor installations in order to test - or at least use the demo installations of ATutor hear at http://atutor.ca/atutor/demo.php in order to have common ground.<br />

				<p>Just tested in a native Windows 7 + IE9. Flash works fine there as well.<br />

Unfortunately we cannot investigate problems until we are able to reproduce the problem ourselves. Much too much time would be spent dealing with problems that are not ATutor related, but related to the OS or browser one might be using.  Typically we do suggest trying our demo site and see if the problem can be reproduced there. Dealing with browsers problems is outside the free help we can offer. Support tickets are always available if someone wants us to login to their system to investigate.</p>
