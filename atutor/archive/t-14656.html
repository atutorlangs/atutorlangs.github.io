				<p>Unfortunately I can not get my paypal sandbox account to function properly inorder to investigate this. It hangs when trying to make a payment.<br />
<br />
However, when I attempted to enroll a student  in a course, a link to make a payment does appear in the Students Payments screen.  <br />
<br />
Make sure the course is Private. That auto approve enrollment is set to Enabled. And, that a fee is entered for the course. Make sure the admin option "Allow instructors..." is turned on if you want to be able to setup p[ayments as an instructor, otherwise you have to do it by entering the course through the admin courses screen, and setting up payments for the course as the system administrator.<br />
<br />
...and please provide details about your system as requested when you post to this forum.</p>
