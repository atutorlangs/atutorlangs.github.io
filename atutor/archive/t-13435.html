				<p>operating system - Server 2003<br />
version of ATutor - 1.5.5<br />
versions of php - 5.2.3<br />
version of mysq l - 5.0<br />
webserver & version - Apache 2.2.6<br />
web browser being used - firefox and I.E.<br />
<br />
As posted in the subject, what I'm trying to do is to change the username to the first and last name of said user or at least add 1 column besides the username that shows the first and last name.  <br />
<br />
I want to add this function to the down loadable csv, the idea is to have a .csv with the results for each user, but that besides the username I have the first/lastname of said user.  This will help instructors evaluate results faster.  <br />
<br />
Included is a picture of the username seen under (login name) in the table.  <br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
If you see the picture included, I want to add the first/lastname of the person between the login name and  date taken columns and that the same table shown can be exported as a csv (like the default one does).<br />
<br />
I know I must modify results_all_csv.php and results_all.php to make it happen, but I'm having trouble doing so.<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated.<br />
<br />

				<p>There's a few ways you could implement this. You could use the get_display_name() function in the login column, which takes as an argument a member id. It will use what ever setting it set in system preference for the Display Name property.<br />
<br />
You can see how thats done in tools/tests/result.php.<br />
<br />
You might build the changes into a patch using the Patcher module, so it can be included in the public source code, and be available for future versions so you don't loose your changes when you upgrade.<br />
<br />
Or, we can be hired to make the changes if you're unable to yourself.</p>
