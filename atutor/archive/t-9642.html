				<p>I don't have a problem, and have detailed my server configuration in another thread. I have a question regarding templates.<br />
<br />
There is another thread regarding adding custom fields to the new user registration. I was successful in getting this to work; however, the question I have is this: When a field is queried, where are the "pretty names" defined? I have looked through all of the template files, but can't find these calls...<br />
An example of what I'm talking about is where a user's gender is called, it is called by "gender", but on the actual registration page it is shown as "Sex". I need to change the field names that the user will see when he/she uses the registration.</p>

				<p>I think you mean the language for the form labels.<br />
<br />
As an admin, all language is managed under System Preferences>Languages.<br />
<br />
Use the Editor in the Language Manager to create custom language.<br />
<br />
Or, turn on translation, then use the translation tools to search for the term "Sex", and change it. <br />
<br />
See the section Language in administrator handbook, and the various language related sections in the developer<br />
