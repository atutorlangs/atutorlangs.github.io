				<p>I installed ATutor 1.5.1 to evaluate its features.<br />
I need to load SCORM 1.2 courses and track student's usage (started and completed lessons, score, etc.).<br />
I tried importing the course as a SCORM 1.2 package inside a course I just created and students can access it as a package "attached" to the course, but don't see any tracking information about the package contents.<br />
Is there a better way to load a SCORM course and track student's usage? If not, will it be possible in the near future?<br />

It is becoming clear to me that I am a bit confused. I have used both Pointecast and Captivate to build scorm packages, 1.2 compliant. I have uploaded them using the "Scorm Packages" area. <br />
I can execute them and they work and play great, I still do not see individual usage information. I click on "My tracker" and the "page" heading is "None Found". Help!<br />
Question: Can I see "who" has taken and completed the package? Maybe I am doing this wrong. We are an adoption education orginazation and would like to be able to provide proof that parents have attended trianing. I like Atutor, it seems easier to use then some of the other LMS' out there. Did I miss something in the documentation? <br />
<br />
Sorry for sounding "dumb"<br />

				<p>As I mentioned, there is not tracking of SCOs. <br />
<br />
And, instructors are not tracked with MyTracker if you are talking about a content packaging<br />
