				<p>hi, I've noticed that the SCORM module must be installed after every upgrade (which is fine), and also translated again (which is worse..) <br />
<br />
you also get the following error:<br />
<br />
"   <br />
* The following error(s) were encountered when trying to install this module:<br />
  o /var/www/[server]/atutor/sco does not exist. Please create it.<br />
"<br />
I moved the sco dir from my previous install over to the new one, but it would have been nicer if you could specify a sco dir outside of the install, so you wouldn't have to do this.. <br />
<br />
how is it ment to be done?</p>

				<p>I would agree with you. <br />
<br />
The module was created by another group, so we haven't had much control over it. Since the original programmer of the module left that group, we've been trying to contact ISN regarding maintaining and perhaps upgrading the module, but there's been no reply.<br />
<br />
Ideally scos should be handled the same way content is.</p>
