				<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm very new to ATutor and I am seeking help on how to attach the SCORM package that i've uploaded into course content, eg. Course ABC. <br />
<br />
Can it also be blended so that a student can take a test on ATutor and when the test is successfully completed a certificate can be issued.<br />
<br />
Any help on this would be greatly appriciated.</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>There are SCORM content packages and SCORM Sharable Content Objects (SCOs). Content packages you can import directly into ATutor content through Manage>Content Import.<br />
<br />
SCOs on the otherhand are standalone units that run in the SCORM player. You'll need to install the SCORM module for ATutor to use SCOs (admin>modules>install modules). SCOs do not become part of the ATutor content (though it might look like it). <br />
<br />
As far as certificates are concerned, I don't imagine you will be able to issue a certificate after a test in a SCO, unless the SCO itself will do that. You can however, with the ATutor certificate module installed, issue a certificate after completing an ATutor created test. See the readme with the certificate module<br />

				<p>Thank you Greg!<br />
<br />
Just another quick question, do you know how to make the SCORM course appear in the navigation bar? <br />
<br />
I have uploaded the SCORM package and would like it so that a student can click the link under "Welcome to ATutor" in the navigation bar and the course to load in a seprate window.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your quick reply.</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>Links to the imported SCORM SCOs only appear on the Packages screen. <br />
<br />
You could create a page after Welcome that introduces the package, with a link in it that opens it in its own window.</p>
