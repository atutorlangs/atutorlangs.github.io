				<p>Does anyone know if it is possible to track which students have posted to the course forum, and how many posts they have made? <br />
<br />
It would be helpful to know at a glance which students are participating in online discussions, and which ones need encouragement.</p>

				<p>This isn't something built in, but it would be relatively easy to do if you have access to the back database with something like phpMyAdmin. <br />
<br />
<br />
There's be lots of ways to do it if you know a little PHP. It would not take much to write a simple query to count forum posts. Perhaps as an addition to the profile page, or as an extension of the forum module, or maybe even a simple standalone module.</p>
