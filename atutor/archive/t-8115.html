Hello, <br />
I've installed Atutor and installation went smoothly. However Users tab is missing when I log in to the system. I cannot add or manage users and administrator accounts. <br />
Besides that whenever I try to create a course and I click to any course tool links (tests, create course, forums etc) all I get is a blank page.<br />
No error messages appear.<br />
Any suggestion of what is going wrong?<br />
:(</p>

				<p>Now this is exactly the same problem that I am facing in my installation. Greg has said he never heard of this one but Now I am glad that someone else is facing the same problem too because we all can now meet to rectify it.<br />
<br />
read my post by 'allbhatias' weblink http://www.atutor.ca/view/7/8104/1.html <br />
<br />
You will understand a little more about this. Links have either been programmed wrongly or the folder structure has been changed but dynamic linking failed to change. This is my view. Tabs are missing coz the system doesn't know where is the theme file.<br />
<br />
If u know more than me, post it on my thread too coz i am just a doctor with barely any tech know how<br />

				<p>II am not sure that we have the same problem.<br />
Links seems to point to the correct position, they just show a blank page.<br />
Also no users tab is shown while all other tabs are being dispalyed perfectly..<br />
I attach a pic which shows that users tab is missing....</p>

				<p>yeah...problem is slightly different but the end result of getting blank pages and inability to add instructors is same........i guess this diff may be because u use apache while i use IIS......anyway........lets see what greg says......he's the expert.<br />
<br />
one more thing......u say operating sys is win xp......does this mean u have installed on a desktop??.........i have installed on a server within my website.</p>
