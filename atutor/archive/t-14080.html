				<p>Ok thanks vegard!<br />
<br />
I thought it might be obvious and so wanted a quick confirmation.<br />
<br />
ATuder v. 1.5.5<br />
Installed on the serverside as already available.<br />
These error messages where splashed on the page as soon as I landed upon them. When I tried to add courses/teachers etc more appeared. I checked a few lines of code that they referred to and found that they related to 'calls' to the database, so there must be a snafu with the SQL interfacing.<br />
<br />
I am thinking of uninstalling and re-installing manually both. However, this time v.1.6.1 and more carefully check SQL permissions.<br />
<br />
This is not new with this host however, my having to get them fix the SQL connection. I know as well as I can know that I have followed all install instructions properly.<br />
<br />
It would however, be nice if they are having to manually fix what just does work per install protocol, so I could better gauge what I am doing correct.<br />
<br />
ATudor sure looks nice, I trust I will have a solid relationship with it. Getting it up and having it solid  <br />
is of first importance. But that is still just the beginning, I have loads of work to get my long dreamed of School on-line.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
