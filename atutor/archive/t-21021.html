			<div class="body">
				<p>I would like to upgrade the Atutor to the new one.<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
1. If I upgrade, do I have to redo all of my courses one at a time? I have many courses and that would take forever to do.<br />
<br />
2. Most of the features are not working such as Gradebook and Files storage, and certificate. Does the new upgrade fix these features?<br />
<br />
3. Can I do a fresh upload for the new Atutor in the same host provider under a different directory so I don[t mess up my current courses? If I do a fresh upload, how can I transfer my old courses (61 courses) without having to enter them one at a time to the new one?<br />
<br />
4. If the New Atutor fresh upload works better and I can transfer my old courses automatically or semiautomatically without having to redo the whole process, I would like to sign up for Technical Support for $175.00.<br />
<br />
Please advise. Thanks,<br />
Much appreciated.<br />

				<p>1. an upgrade will not change your courses.<br />
<br />
2. it depends on why these features are not working whether an upgrade will fix them. They should work fine without any change to a default php/mysql/apache installation. If a provider turns off some capabilities, like file uploads for instance, an upgrade won't change things.<br />
<br />
3. you can do a fresh install beside the current version, and copy over each course as a course backup (61 times).<br />
<br />
4. An upgrade is the way to go, I think. A backup of the old version gets created, so if anything should go wrong, it is possible to revert. Or, if you don't mind copying all the courses 1-by-1, a fresh install would also work.<br />
<br />
As I recall, you have a custom theme. A 3 ticket pack should cover the upgrade/install and a theme upgrade, though depending on the theme there may be a little more effort involved.</p>

<br />
Would upgrading also upgrade to acontent or is it a separate install? <br />
<br />
These are the following features that I currently have and need for them to be optimized as they are not working properly:<br />
<br />
1. Gradebook and Certificates: I need to have the  ability to create tests, grade them and issue certificates and for students to be able to view them. Right now, the process is cumbersome and I can't get the gradebook to record the exams and/or assignments. Grades from exams are not viewable by students, but instructors are able to view the grades and able to edit grades.<br />
<br />
2. File Storage or something to manage assignments better. <br />
I require assignments so I need a place for students to upload assignments and receive their grades instead of the file storage as it is giving me lots of trouble. Instructors are able to view and grade assignments that students HAND In, but students are not able to view instructor comments.<br />
<br />
3. The exams are difficult and time consuming, specially matching/labeling pictures. Is there a better way for matching exams?<br />
<br />
I would like to know if you suggest getting these features troubleshooted before I upgrade Atutor or should I upgrade first?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

With the Atutor Upgrade, does it install the Acontent as well, or is it separate install. I would like both of them installed please.<br />
<br />
I have the following modules and I would like to keep/upgrade them or add the new ones.<br />
<br />
Atutor Payments (upgrade or keep)<br />
Disclaimer (new)<br />
Certify (upgrade to new certificate system)<br />
Assignment Dropbox (please reinstall as I need one that students can access. File Storage is not working. Thanks.)<br />
<br />
Please let me know if we can do these upgrades together, or should I upgrade first then install/reinstall these modules later?<br />
<br />
thanks.</p>

				<p>There seems to be something going on on your server if all these things are not working properly. <br />
<br />
1.The gradebook is working fine on our installations without any adjustment. Make sure tests are set to only 1 attempt to have them available to add to the gradebook.<br />
<br />
1b. Once the certificate module has been installed, you need to create the certificate template. You can take the default template and adjust it. There is a little effort involved in creating the template, which is described in the module's README file, linked from the module listing in the admin's module manager. You will need Adobe Acrobat to create your template.<br />
<br />
2. the assignment dropbox relies on File Storage. If FS is not working, the dropbox won't work. Again, it it seems to be an issue on your server. <br />
<br />
3. I'm not sure what you mean by "is there a better way." There'll be some effort involved in creating test questions with any system you might use. You could try something like Respondus for instance, then export from it and import into ATutor.  <br />
<br />
AContent is a separate application, not part of an ATutor install.<br />

				<p>Payments requires a PayPal account. Once installed see the README for details on the type of Paypal account needed. The module has not changed significantly in a while, so it would be a reinstall of the current module.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer is an easy module to install. You'd need to write the actual disclaimer text and add it through the module.<br />
<br />
Certify, as described above, needs a certificate template created by you (perhaps based on the default included with the module). <br />
<br />
Assignment Dropbox is a straight forward install, but does require a working file storage module.<br />
<br />
It will likely be a few weeks before we can put this all together. We are waiting on an AContent release, which would be required to have it setup with the current version of ATutor. We're hoping late November for its release.<br />

For now I need to figure out the File Storage. I'll post a new question on my File Storage Issue.</p>
