				<p>If you are asking for help, provide lots of detail so problems can be reproduced.<br />
 <br />
  copies of error messages - can't find the file<br />
 <br />
It appears  new content, glossary, faq, assignments write tot he mysql db ok, write to the content directory ok, but the system keeps saying   File cannot be found.<br />
<br />
The path is correct tot the content file in config<br />
The only thing I see is content pages when written are assigned an owner 99 whereas alll other directories are assigned 32150   <br />
<br />
I can't change permission to directory 1, 2 etc thus I cannot see the files in ATutor <br />
<br />
How can I change these permissions to find the files?</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>Which file in ATutor causes the writing of the files such as content pages, glossary pages, assignments?   It appears to be assigning ownership of 99 to all the files which makes it unreadable to the application and I as root owner of the server cannot even telnet change the owner ship.  I tried deleting the files and I get an error.   <br />
<br />
Until the content created files can be 'seen' this robust LMS is worthless to me   WILL SOMEONE HELP!</p>

				<p>Something appears to have gone wrong in the installation, or permisisons were changed manually after the installation. Rather than trying to track down the problem, you should probably reinstall ATutor, and pay particular attention during the step when permissions are set.  You should not need to change any permissions on files after the installations.</p>
