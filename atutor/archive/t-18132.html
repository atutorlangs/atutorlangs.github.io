Try downloading a fresh copy of ATutor and installing again. Maybe the whole ATutor bundle was corrupted when you downloaded or unzipped.</p>

				<p>Maybe it is the way I am installing. I am using an unzip program to first unzip all the files to a place on my hard drive, with all the folders. Then I am copying these files to host with my FTP program. Is this an okay method? I can't find any way to unzip them on the server itself.<br />

If you are able to login to the shell (command prompt) for your Web space account, unpack the file there after uploading it using:<br />
<br />
tar xzvf ATutor-x.x.x.tar.gz<br />
<br />
If you don't have shell access, some ftp clients have an unzip/tar utility, allowing you to unzip on the server by selecting a command from the FTP client.<br />

				<p>Hi Greg,<br />
<br />
I don't mind installing again but I don't get the feeling this is going to fix the problem since I have the latest stable build installed. I wanted to point out that the file you told me to download and install (Application.class.php) is not the same size as the one in the installation build. The one in the installation build is 14,805 bytes and the one you had me download is 13,001 bytes. I am not sure if this is important but I wanted to mention it to you.<br />
<br />
I use an unzip program and I get no errors. All the files appear to be there. And I am uploading them carefully. After uploading, the installation goes all the way through with no hitches. But trying to view one of my courses that I just created gives the error message above consistently, whether I use the original file or the one that you told me to use. I wonder if there is something in the way I am creating the course that is associated with the error.<br />
<br />
I will install it all again. I am using this file:  ATutor-1.6.3.tar.gz, by the way. <br />
<br />
I just have my doubts.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

				<p>We have confirmed that the current ATutor bundle is fine. We've installed it many times without any problems. <br />
<br />
Careful as you may have been, FTPing file-by-file is not the recommended way to install ATutor. The chances of something going wrong with such an upload is very high. Talk to your provider and find out from them how to do an install as described in the installation instructions.</p>
