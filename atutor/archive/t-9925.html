				<p>Hi,<br />
We are running aTutor for our courses and tests and it has been working fine for the past 2 years.. however now the main navigation links dont work in IE 7 while they continue to work in IE 6 and fire fox. <br />
In IE & the links on the main nav like " Borwse Courses" "Search" etc have not starting pointing to links like users/users/browse.php?course=60&this_course=60&show<br />
<br />
when it should only be users/browse.php?course=60&this_course=60&show.<br />
<br />
which is fine in IE 6 and FF but adds the folder name twice in IE 7.<br />
<br />
Did anybody else come across such a problem.. our entire site is down in IE 7 what could be the reason.. <br />
I think we are running an older verion of Atutor not the latest one.. but would that make such a difference?<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated<br />
Thanks in advance</p>

				<p>Which version of ATutor and which theme? We can not reproduce the problem on our systems.<br />
<br />
Have you tried accessing ATutor from a different computer?</p>
