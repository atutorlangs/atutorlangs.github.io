				<p>You can remove it, as long as it is not replaced with another copyright notice that might give the viewer the impression someone else holds the copyright. We'd prefer it stay there though, in the interest of promoting use of ATutor.<br />
<br />
You can add a secondary copyright, under Manage>Properties>Copyright</p>

				<p>Hello,<br />
I think that GPL notice should be intact. I guess that it should not disturb anyone or prevent anyone to do business as planned.<br />
Notice on freedom of software is anyway a virtue of ATutor.<br />

				<p>I agree completely on that, Vedran.<br />
<br />
The question was asked as a matter principle; sometimes I come across companies that do not want to display any copyright notices - for example on their Joomla web page.<br />
<br />
Personally I try to plug ATutor as a very capable LMS software with GPL freedom, and for our own applications we are proud to have the notice in there.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to know if was legal to remove it if a client should insist...</p>

				<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
If you read GPL version 2 (you can find text of all GPL versions on www.gnu.org) you will find teh following statement:<br />
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br />
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br />
along with the Program..<br />
<br />
I understand what you say and I was dissapointed that some Joomla members do not ask to keep licencing terms visible.<br />
<br />
best wishes,<br />

			<div class="body">
				<p>You can find in version 2 of GPL teh following statemenet too in which tehre is an exception for display of Licencing terms:<br />
 c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br />
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br />
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
