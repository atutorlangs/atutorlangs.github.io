 Hi am having recent issue with  the file manager not working - it appears, images can be previewed, but when I click on the insert button, either nothing happens, or I get an insert which just says "Alternate  Text"  and no image or link.  nothing has been updated on my server, so what was working isn't? any ideas - <br />
 looking a the Apache error log - the only thing relevant are errors when we  use the file manager such as:<br />
[Tue Sep 28 09:06:18 2010] [error] [client 128.xxx.xxx.xxx] File does not exist: /Library/WebServer/Documents/Tutor/editor/example_data, referer: http://cxxx.xxx.xxx/Tutor/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/advlink/link.htm<br />
[Tue Sep 28 09:07:49 2010] [error] [client 128.xxx.xxx.xxx] File does not exist: /Library/WebServer/Documents/Tutor/editor/example_data, referer: http://cxxx.xxx.xxx/Tutor/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/advlink/link.htm<br />
[Tue Sep 28 09:13:17 2010] [error] [client 128.xxx.xxx.xxx] File does not exist: /Library/WebServer/Documents/Tutor/editor/example_data, referer: http://cxxx.xxx.xxx/Tutor/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/advimage/image.htm<br />
[Tue Sep 28 09:19:13 2010] [error] [client 128.xxx.xxx.xxx] File does not exist: /Library/WebServer/Documents/Tutor/editor/example_data, referer: http://cxxx.xxx.xxx/Tutor/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/advimage/image.htm<br />
<br />
so I guess there may be an issue with tiny_mce? or its referencing to file locations - however the example_data referred to doesn't exist in the folder mentioned, so what's going on there?  this was working  up until very recently.<br />
<br />
any help appreciated, as it makes image insertion a pain.</p>

				<p>It's hard to say what's happening. We don't keep a version of 1.5.5 around anymore to test this. It's getting old.<br />
<br />
I would guess that your server was recently upgraded to PHP 5.3.0 which is somewhat incompatible with ATutor 1.5.5. My suggestion is to upgrade ATutor to a current version. Version 2.0.1 will be available in the next week or so, or if you need this resolved more quickly you might install ATutor 2.0, or revert back to pre PHP 5.3.0</p>

				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
What have you changed recently? Did you changed the location of your directory? Added symlinks? Moved to a virtual host?<br />
