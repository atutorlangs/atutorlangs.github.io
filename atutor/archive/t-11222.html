				<p>hi all am working on our e-learning system anad i decided to use atutor as our platform since its so flexible and easy to use. In the sam token i would really like some help on two things:<br />
1. I would like to include a registration number on the login page since am planning on intergrating it with our Master lists for students. How do i go about it?<br />
2. I want to include video content and the demo gave me some ideas. However i wanted a player that would allow users to pause, play and stop the video themselves. More like a Youtube player. Any ideas how i can achieve this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</p>

				<p>Just turn on the Master List feature and it will automatically insert the registration number field (or what ever you end up calling it) on the registration page. This allows a person to create an account on the system. You would not use it on the login screen, though you could have the registration number be the login name.<br />
<br />
Regarding video, in the current version you'd need to use the Object or Embed HTML elements, and write them manually. In the coming releae, only a few days away, you will be able to just click the Insert button next to a movie file, and ATutor will insert the "media" tag, which automatically converts to the appropriate HTML tag used to display that content. Assuming the user has the appropriate plugin or multimedia application installed (e.g. Windows Media Player, Real Player). ATutor, and most other similar systems, do not have there own custom player, though it might be something to add in the future as such players become more readily available..</p>
