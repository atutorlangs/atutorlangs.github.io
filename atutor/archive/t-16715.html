				<p>I have had experience with some users of similar problem. But, that problem did not appear because of ATutor. It has appeared because of cookies in Internet Explorer. When we installed Firefox and periodically performed Clear Private Data such a problem disappeared. ACtually, it looks like IE was not handling sessions well and even if you change password it was offering pages from cache memory and with some other cookies.<br />
I suggest you to use Firefox and try to do that with clean install of Firefox. Indeed, from time to time use Clear Private Data which you can find in Tools menu.<br />
If your problem persists please let me know.<br />
