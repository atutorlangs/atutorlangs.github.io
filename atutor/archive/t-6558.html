				<p>I'm a beginner in setting up Tutor Environments like ATutor. I was succeful in setting up ATutor on my server. Thanks to all the people who put their valuable time into the making.<br />
<br />
I've been seeing SCORM everywhere. I've read about it in this website but could't understand a bit about it. What actually is it? Does it mean that I can put tests made by others in my site? Also, if the above thing is tru then are there any sites that offer such tests that can be installed on my site?<br />
<br />
Please Help...</p>

				<p>SCORM is essentially a standard way of defining the relationships between a set off content object using an XML file. Of course its more complex than that. Giving you the full story here goes a little beyond the type of support we can afford to offer.<br />
<br />
There is loads of information out there about SCORM if you want to do the research.<br />
<br />
No SCORM does not allow you to use others test (though as part of a sharable content object SCO I suppose yes it does). The IMS QTI standard is used to define interoperable questions and test. QTI is not supported in ATutor yet, but it is high on our list of things to do.</p>

				<p>Oh... I had a different opinion. Anyways, even if i didn't understand it, i still understood that it wouldn't be helpful to me... Thank you for your valuable time....</p>
