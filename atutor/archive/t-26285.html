				<p>If you are asking for help, provide lots of detail so problems can be reproduced.<br />
<br />
Things to describe: <br />
  Operating system ATutor is installed on - linux<br />
  ATutor version - 2.2.1<br />
  Patch #s applied -<br />
  ATutor theme name -default<br />
  PHP version -<br />
  MySQL version -<br />
  Webserver & version -<br />
  Copies of error messages -<br />
  Changes to default settings -<br />
  Web browser being used -<br />
  ...and anything else relevant -<br />
<br />
This is a default install of Atutor, from a few weeks ago on a dotCanada hosted website<br />
<br />
when i copy and paste html content (as code) from an html editor into the HTML page content box, or copy formatted html content into the HTML Visual Editor, i am getting two instances of the content.  The first version is a link to the second.  In other words the first version is a toc for the second version. On inspection, it is showing as div#toc.  I get the same result when i open the source page in Firefox and copy/paste from there.  It does not happen if i go through notepad, but that strips all my links.<br />
<br />
The only reference i found in the forum to this was for version 1.5 but that seems to not apply to version 2.2.1.  How do i remove the div#toc (or whatever implementation is currently in use?  <br />
<br />
thanks<br />

				<p>div#toc is where a table of contents gets generated. It is turned on for users who are not logged in. For logged in users it can be turn on/off in user preferences.<br />
<br />
If the content is showing up in div#toc, that probably means there is a broken heading tag. The Toc is generated from the headings on a page.</p>

I checked the code.  It is of the form<br />
&lt;h2>...&lt;/h2><br />
 &lt;p>....&lt;/p> <br />
 ...<br />
&lt;ul><br />
 &lt;li>...&lt;/li><br />
 ...<br />
 &lt;li>...&lt;/li><br />
&lt;h2>...&lt;/h2><br />
 &lt;p>...&lt;/p><br />
<br />
there are no broken codes. But the entire contents is being displayed as a hyperlink, followed by the contents again.  I have deleted, saved, redone it several times.  I've pasted it into the html view, and into the visual editor.  Same results each time.<br />
<br />
Are there other possible causes?<br />

				<p>It seems to be an issue in some cases, when the HTML of the page is more than basic HTML. When its simple headings and paragraphs the TOC seems to work as expected.<br />
<br />
I have added the issue to the tracker for further investigation. You can follow the bug there. It might be a little while before we get to it.<br />

In the meantime, you can disable the TOC by logging in as the admin, then Users>Default Preferences>Navigation.</p>
