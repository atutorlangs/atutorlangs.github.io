Sorry in advance for any silly questions, just having a hard time finding in documentation:<br />
How can you set students to automatically join alumni after completing the content (in this case a launch sco)? Not seeing how to track completion of courses, scoring, nor how the course is removed from Course list once completed. Thanks in advance!!</p>

				<p>Students must be manually added to the alumni list when the course is completed. Alumni continue to have access to the course after it is complete. Instructors need to decide whether they want past students to have access. Automatically adding them would create problems for the majority who do not maintain alumni lists.<br />
<br />
SCOs are not handled like regular ATutor content. They are indepedent units that run outside the ATutor tracker. They are more intended to be content units rather than an entire course (although entire courses do exists). Data is stored in the sco database tables, thought the tools to retrieve the data have not been created yet. <br />
<br />
To remove a course from a student's course list, they need to be remove manually from the course enrollment list. <br />
<br />
Tracking completion of courses is not something that would be easy to implement, since a definition of complete can vary  significantly across courses. In the interest of leaving ATutor adaptable to what ever teaching stategies an instructor might use, we're unlikely to add an automatic course complete function since that would limit how one defines complete. From the users perspective, SCO tracking is displayed in the bullets that precede an items in the sco table of contents once it has been open through the Packages tool. red, yellow, green<br />

Matthai Kurian, who create the SCORM RTE may want to comment further on data collection.</p>
