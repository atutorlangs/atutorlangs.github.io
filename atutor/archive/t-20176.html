				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have 2 file transfer problems on the following setup:<br />
<br />
Operating system  - Windows NT 6.0 (Parallels/Plesk)<br />
Version of ATutor - 1.6.4<br />
Versions of php - 5.2.13<br />
Version of mysql - 5.0.45-community-nt<br />
Webserver & version - IIS 7<br />
Test ATutor location- http://sandbox.isrg.org.uk/ATutor<br />
<br />
Patch #s applied - All suggested<br />
ATutor theme name - Default<br />
Changes to default settings - None<br />
<br />
Copies of error messages - see below<br />
Web browser being used - see below<br />
  ...and anything else relevant - see below<br />
<br />
<br />
PROBLEM #1<br />
==========<br />
File transfers time out after 2 minutes (slow connections cannot upload/download moderately sized files). This has been a problem since installing ATutor; I don't think it is specifically an ATutor issue, but any pointers as to what may be at fault would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
The following is what I am experiencing:<br />
<br />
An html form upload succeeds with file sizes of 200 kB & 5 MB (80 seconds), but<br />
<br />
- 10 MB fails after 130 seconds ("The connection was reset" in firefox / "Connection terminated unexpectedly" in epiphany)<br />
- 14 MB fails after 130 seconds ("The connection was reset" in firefox / "Connection terminated unexpectedly" in epiphany)<br />
<br />
From ATutor,<br />
- 5MB succeeds (80 seconds)<br />
- 10MB fails at 180 seconds with a server generated error : "The page cannot be displayed because an interanal server error has occurred."<br />
- 14 MB fails at 220 seconds with the browser error: "The connection was reset"<br />
<br />
The iis/php setup is as follows:<br />
My ISP support report that "The IIS timeout is set at 600 seconds and the max upload size is 100MB.".<br />
php.ini has:<br />
	upload_max_filesize = 128M<br />
	post_max_size = 64M<br />
	memory_limit = 128M<br />
I know these would be better with memory_limit > post_max_size > upload_max_size but the file sizes failing are nowhere near these limits.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PROBLEM #2<br />
==========<br />
File downloads recently (a week ago) started to fail completely.<br />
<br />
Tested using 3 different browsers, transfers start, the file seems to download, but the browser isn't notified of the transfer progress or completion. After 2 minutes (see problem #1 above) the server times out.<br />
 - IE8 - file is transferred but fails to complete (isn't copied from Local Apps\temp);<br />
 - Firefox/flock - file is downloaded as a .part, but is cleaned up when transfer times out (Error message reads: "C:\Documents and Settings\user\Desktop\test5MB.zip.part could not be saved, because the source file could not be read. Try again later, or contact the server administrator."<br />
 - Chrome - the part file is made available and is complete after the 2 minute timeout.<br />
<br />
Looking into this further, all downloads seem to defautl to the file type "octet-stream", and this seems to be because the php test<br />
	[php]if (!isset($mime))[/php]<br />
ALWAYS returns false (!!?!)<br />
<br />
After this started happening, I set up a completely fresh test installation (http://sandbox.isrg.org.uk/ATutor) with all defaults, which also has this problem.<br />
<br />
The only other thing that may have a bearing is that I cycled the Plesk php setting from fast-cgi -> isapi -> cgi -> fast-cgi on the Friday before this happened.<br />
<br />
Other php applications installed on the server do not have this problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
