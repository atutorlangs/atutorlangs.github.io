				<p>Hi guys,<br />
<br />
another stupid question from me:<br />
What is the relation between aTutor and aContent??<br />
<br />
I read I should upgrade aContent if I am running aTutor 2.0.1. But I was not aware I was using aContent at all. <br />
Is it part of aTutor, so does this mean I must update part of my installation? Or is it a tool to be used on the side? If so: Does that have advantages over creating content right where it is to be used: In aTutor?<br />
<br />
I will gladly RTFM, if someone could point me to the FM that explains such basic questions.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Evelien</p>

				<p>To begin answering my own question (O hope my assumptions are correct):<br />
<br />
aContent is PART OF aTutor: It is the part that is used to create the content.<br />
<br />
But this leads to a further question: Can we create a trimmed-down version of aTutor, that is intended for use by students only?<br />
<br />
The teachers in my project are interested in separating the creation of content from the teaching task. aContent seems to be exactly what they need for creation.<br />
<br />
But aTutor would still be able to create content, making it more complex than needed for use in the classroom...</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>AContent is a content repository based on the ATutor content editor. It can be used to create and share content across ATutor installations, or across other systems that support IMS interoperability standards. AContent might be used where content is being reused by different instructors across different courses, or where the content authors are not necessarily the course instructors.<br />
<br />
AContent is what you would use if you wanted to separate the content creation process from the course creation and delivery process. It is possible to create users without content editor privileges in ATutor, but that would mean they could not import content from the repository.  <br />
<br />
ATutor is very adaptable, all tools are optional. The only required option in a course is the Home tab in the main navigation across the top. Experiment by turning turning things on or off (Manage>Course Tools), and by assigning privileges to various users (Manage>Enrolment), giving the access to only those tool they should be using.</p>
