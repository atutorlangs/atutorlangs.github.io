				<p>Hello, I thought I had resolved the issue of Blank page when Request Enrollment. I created a new course, and the blank page disappeared. <br />
<br />
However, after I transferred all of the questions to the new exam, and added the lessons/information, I re-registered, and now the blank page reappeared.<br />
<br />
1. Register.<br />
2. Browse Courses.<br />
3. Click on Course Title. It goes to Request Enrollment.<br />
Click on Request Enrollment. Blank Page.<br />
<br />
http://cultureadvantage.org/ATutor/users/private_enroll.php<br />
<br />
4. However, I click on back arrow, it takes me back to the Request Enrollment.<br />
5. I click on Payments, and it would let me pay.<br />
<br />
If I click on Payments without clicking on Request Enrollment, I get the message that I have to enroll.<br />
<br />
My other courses do not show a blank page after Request Enrollment.<br />
<br />
The course link:<br />

				<p>I just did a test on a local system, with paypal. Everything seems fine, unable to reproduce the blank screen.<br />
<br />
Viewing the error log is your best bet to understanding what happens when the blank screen appears. You may need the help of your provider to view the log, or maybe its available through your system's control panel.<br />
<br />
Another option might be to copy the file to back it up, then replace it with a fresh copy from the source code repository, at:<br />

<br />
This file is for the current development version. You may need to go back to earlier versions if the most recent does not work:<br />

				<p>Thanks Greg, for checking. What I dont understand is I don't get the blank screen with other courses. Just for this Medical Spanish Reproductive System course. If I change the source code, would it affect the other courses, it the new one does not help?<br />
<br />
To change the source code, you mean to upload this into my host provider server?<br />
<br />
After  back up a course,how do I plug it into the new course?</p>

				<p>Only one course has the problem? That's strange. Are you cutting and pasting anything from MSword into the course? Word content has been know to produce problems of various sorts, because of the invisible foreign characters it inserts.<br />
<br />
Rename the old file to take a backup you can revert to if something goes wrong, then use the CPanel file manager to upload the new one in its place.</p>

				<p>I think the instructor and I figured it out. We were creating dummy accounts to test the new course. I was deleting the accounts after we tried them because they require new emails each time. So I think that messed up the course because I would create a user, then delete the user after they already paid. Then try to re-register again. I don't know if it makes sense, but after deleting a user, and then re-registering, when the username is registered the second time, the blank payment page appears.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if I need to explain it better. But that's what has happening.</p>
