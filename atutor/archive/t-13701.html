				<p>We're currently using a 1.5 version of ATutor, and we're thinking about upgrading to 1.6<br />
<br />
We made a full backup of our courses from our 1.5 version and uploaded them to our 1.6 ATutor.<br />
<br />
The problem is that some quotation marks were ignored from our content which makes our embedded SWF files unreadable.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
&lt;param name="wmode" value="" /> BECAME &lt;param name="wmode" value="/><br />
<br />
the backup omitted the other " in the value tag.<br />
<br />
Another problem is that when we restore our backup, the content is scrambled. They do not appear in the order that they originally were.<br />
<br />
Any insights? Thank you very much in advance.<br />

				<p>You should not need to take backups of individual courses to be restored. A copy of the entire database should be sufficient, to be restored only if something goes wrong during your upgrade. <br />
<br />
<br />
The missing quotes is likely due to cutting and pasting from another application. The quotes when copied this way will break in some cases.This is fairly common when pasting from a windows clipboard. To avoid this problem, copy the markup into an plain text editor, then paste it back into ATutor.</p>
