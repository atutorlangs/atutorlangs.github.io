				<p>Hi, Hope someone might be able to help out...<br />
<br />
I have just completed a fresh install of ATutor's latest. All went well. <br />
<br />
I did this because the old atutor files were attacked somehow on my server and iframes from tracking sites, put throughout the files. I couldn't clean up all these files, as it destroyed some of the coding/html - so I installed a fresh version of ATutor. (I still have the old version on my external hard drive, off the server)<br />
<br />
However, I'd like to use my old course content. Any way of doing that. I went through the documentation and couldn't find anything for this situation. <br />
<br />
I have the old content and put this in the new content folder created. I have installed using the previous old database. Any way of getting the content to appear on the new Atutor? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.<br />
<br />
David</p>

				<p>You would need to run the Upgrade option when running the installer. see the upgrade instructions: <br />
