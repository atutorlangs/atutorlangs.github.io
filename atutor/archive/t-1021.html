				<p>I was wondering if AChat is supposed to work with the default install of ATutor.  Whenever I click on Discussions/Chat/Enter the Chat it does nothing.  It just links to a blank window.  I though maybe it has something to do with popup blocking but I turned that off and there was no change.  I installed the stand-alone AChat and it worked fine.  <br />
<br />
Does the AChat in /ATutor/discussion/achat store the messages in the database or something?  I noticed there was not msgs folder so I added one just to see if that would make a difference (nope).<br />
<br />
Thanks.  And ATutor is great!!!!!</p>
