				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I'd like to create a course that will include tests with open-ended questions that are flagged for review by an instructor. The instructor will then accept or reject answers based on what's written. <br />
<br />
Ideally, rejected questions would go back to the student for review. The test wouldn't be considered done until all questions' answers have been accepted.<br />
<br />
Is that possible?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Sean</p>

				<p>I'm thinking that this is pretty straight forward. <br />
<br />
Create a test with your questions and set the test properties to not releasing results before the test is marked. Set unlimited tries on the test. Then, set a value in points on the questions, and the students will not see the results before they are marked (e.g. an instructor has changed the points from 0 to, say, 1)<br />
<br />
Instruct the users that they will have to continue to take the test untill they can see their results on the tests and surveys page.</p>
