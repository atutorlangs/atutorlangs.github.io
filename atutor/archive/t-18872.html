				<p>It looks like your include/config.inc.php file was left writable after ATutor was installed. Have a look at it and see if there's anything that looks out of place. The only thing that should be in this file is variable settings and comments.<br />
<br />
If editing the config file does not help, talk to your service provider to see if they have a recent backup of your site. Restore the file from the backup.  Then remove write permissions from the file. See the installation instructions for details.<br />
<br />
Once you get your system back up, apply all patches, or upgrade to 1.6.3.</p>

				<p>Thanks for your interest. I installed the lastest version of the autor. I hav taken all permisions on config.inc.php file except reading, and I deleted the install directory. Everything seemed o till I tried to change the language to german. As far as I remember I have imported the german language succesfully. And then I deleted english. Now I can't enter the site 'There are no languages installed!' I'm sure I imported the german. But I think I did something wrong. How can I get back to the system?<br />
I look forward to hearing from you soon. <br />
By the way, I searched the problem in this forum. I think the search link of this forum doesn't work well. <br />

				<p>Reinstall the language packs. You can download them from here.<br />
http://www.atutor.ca/atutor/translate/index.php<br />
<br />
You should still be able to get around ATutor without language by reading the language tokens, which in most cases resemble the actually English language used to replace the tokens.<br />
<br />
You can also unzip a lnaguage pack and manually install the language.sql file using something like phpMyAdmin.</p>
