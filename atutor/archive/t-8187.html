				<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I am planning on creating about 5 courses with about 30-50 total learners at any given time within the upcoming year.  How much space, bandwidth, and anything else relevant, should I be looking for in a host?<br />
<br />
Thankyou.</p>

				<p>5 courses with 50 students will run on any ISP. That would be a very small ATutor installation.<br />
<br />
The space you need will depend on what you plan on presenting as content. Movies for example, take up a lot of space. Text and image based courses take up little space. If the latter, 25mb per course should be more than enough (5 to10MB/course will probably do). <br />
<br />
See the system requirements for details about supporting software that needs to be present. Nowadays all ISPs have this software installed. You just need to make sure the versions are sufficient.<br />
