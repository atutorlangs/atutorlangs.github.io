				<p>If you are asking for help, provide lots of detail so problems can be reproduced.<br />
<br />
Things to describe: <br />
  operating system  - xp2<br />
version of ATutor - 1.5.4<br />
versions of php - 5.1.4<br />
version of mysql - 4.1.7<br />
webserver & version - Apache/2.0.58 (Win32) PHP/5.1.4<br />
your ATutor location- http://localhost/atutor <br />
 <br />
copies of error messages - Session cookies must be enabled in your browser to login<br />
<br />
  changes to default settings -<br />
  web browser being used - IE6 <br />
<br />
  and anything else relevant -  i think everything is working fine and cookies are also being written to the cookies.save_path folder as c:\mycookies. but the problem think here is with the folder read only attribute which is assigned to the each folder by default by windows XP2. i have tried all possible tricks to remove the read-only attribute on cookies folder, but was unable to remove it. at last i hope that Greg you may figure out some way that the atutor code does not be dependent on the read attribute of the cookie folder. i hope you would definitly help out the situation. thanks.</p>

				<p>This is unrelated to ATutor. You will have to get PHP working correctly before trying to install ATutor.<br />
<br />
You should consult the PHP documentation.</p>
