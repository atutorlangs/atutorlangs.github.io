				<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
  OS - Linux (I believe)<br />
  ATutor version - **Not sure, installed in Nov 2010**<br />
  Patch #s applied -<br />
  ATutor theme name -<br />
  PHP version - PHP Version 5.2.17<br />
  MySQL version - MS SQL server 2005<br />
  Webserver & version -<br />
  Copies of error messages -<br />
  Changes to default settings -<br />
  Web browser being used - Safari, Chrome, Firefox<br />
  ...and anything else relevant -<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
I'm having difficulty staying logged in on ATutor. As you can see above, the version running is outdated (I want to upgrade but I'm afraid I'll risk losing my courses if I do it myself), but I've concluded that the version may not be the issue (although an upgrade might help).<br />
<br />
While logged in and navigating my ATutor courses, I will be forced back to a login page at random. I'll click "Jump" to a course (which may or may not kick me off right then), and usually after clicking a lesson under "Course Navigation" I'm greeted with the login page. I was trying to figure this problem out on a Windows 7 PC using Firefox and Chrome, then moved to my Macbook and cleared the caches on Chrome+Firefox+Safari but the problem remained.<br />
<br />
I just changed my main ISP from a mobile 3G hotspot to a Hughes satellite system last Thursday, but I hadn't experienced any problems until last evening. As it turns out, if I tether my smartphone to a different Windows 7 laptop, then everything works fine with no navigation issues and I can stay logged in without worry.<br />
<br />
From what I can muster, this problem is specific to using my new ISP. That's confusing, however, because it *will* allow me to log in and browse to some degree before logging me out. For example, new account registration works, but enrolling in a course and trying to navigate that as a student will bring me back to a login page. <br />
<br />
I contacted my hosting provider, they had no problems logging in. What would be happening to abruptly force me back to the login page, however, if every other website I browse to with login options work fine? I'm hoping a new installation would eliminate this problem, but should I be worried about doing an upgrade on my own?<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

				<p>If you've deleted the ATutor related cookies from your browser and that did not help, open the include/lib/constants.inc.php file and find the value for VERSION about half way down the file.<br />
<br />
It does sound like a cookie problem if your provider was able to login. Try yourself logging into ATutor with a system or browser you've never used to login to it before. If it works, then the problem is very likely cookies.</p>

				<p>Greg, thank you for your reply. I did some looking on that file and I'm running version 2.0.1.<br />
<br />
It's definitely something relating to which internet I'm using. I just used my smartphone on both this and another computer and it loads through fine there as well.</p>

				<p>A couple of steps that may help:<br />
<br />
1. Login ATutor as admin, go to "Patcher" tab, install all the patches;<br />
<br />
2. Not only just clean up the browser cache, removing all the browser cookies is essential. The cookie issue is unlikely at the server side;<br />
<br />
3. Restart browser.</p>
