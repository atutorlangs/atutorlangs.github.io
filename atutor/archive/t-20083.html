				<p>I am using ATutor-1-6-2 and for each course I have setup group and then assignment for each group. The problem is that students of the same group can see and download each other files. How can I prevent this matter? Is there a way to hide each student's assigment from others.</p>

				<p>The students might hand in the document into a group instead of an assignment.<br />
<br />
In "File Storage" -> "workspace" drop down list, there are 2 sections: Group & Assignment. The file submitted into a group is considered a group file and are shared by all students in this group, while the file submitted into an assignment is hidden from other students and can only be viewed and downloaded by the instructor.</p>

				<p>I don't have the following link for students.<br />
In "File Storage" -> "workspace" drop down list, there are 2 sections: Group & Assignment<br />
But I have this path for instructors.<br />
What I have done is as follow:<br />
1) Create a group<br />
2) Add assignment for that group<br />
3) Give access to file storge for that group<br />
4) Students can upload their files when they select the specific group<br />
Please let me know where I have made a mistake. Ireally need to fix this problem as soon as possibel because at the moment students can see each other files.</p>

				<p>"4) Students can upload their files when they select the specific group"<br />
<br />
This action is to submit group files, which are intended to be shared by all group members.<br />
<br />
The correct way is, for instance, assignment A is added into group G, instead of selecting G in file storage to upload the file, students should upload the file into "My Files", then select the check box of the uploaded file and click "hand-in" button, follow the steps to submit it to assignment A.</p>

				<p>You are right.<br />
<br />
The file should actually be uploaded into group "mapping", where the assignment associated with the group is recognized, then hand in the file into assignment "surfer" from here, as a group file. The student or you can delete the file from the group once the submission is complete so that other group members won't be able to access it, but you, as the instructor, is still able to access the submissions from "file storage" -> workspace "mapping".</p>
