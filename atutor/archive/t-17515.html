				<p>Why does the gradebook only allow tests with attempts allowed set to 1 and can this be changed?<br />
<br />
Aside from the gradebook, how does a teacher review the results of tests that their students have taken?<br />

On a side note, i don't think the "Subscribe to this thread" feature is working as i have started multiple threads but only received notifications of replies once or twice.</p>

we're working on a new module for student certificates, in that module you can add tests with several attempts. you can expect as beta release probably next week, keep an eye on the community forum or atutor.no</p>
