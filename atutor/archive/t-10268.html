				<p>Does a way exist to get a report that shows the start and the end date of when a user starts and completes the course? I looked through the database thinking I could just write a report outside of the application but I do not see a start and complete date anywhere.<br />

TIA, Gabriel</p>

				<p>There is a course release date, if you wanted to try using that.<br />
<br />
There isn't a specific field for defining a start/end. This is something you might include with the course description.</p>

				<p>The release date doesn't  capture the actual start date in asynchronous courses where a student can start taking the course whenever they choose.  All of our courses are like that since they are provided free to the public (365/24/7) but for reporting purposes I need to track the number of people who started or "enrolled" in a course each month.  Since ATutor does not consider these types of students, I added an enroll_date field to the AT_course_enrollment table in the database and modified the enroll.php file to capture and store the information. Fortunately, that is a simple fix but I wish it were an ATutor "feature".<br />
<br />
I think the end date can be determined from the last_accessed field in the AT_member_track table.  However, I also think before the data is captured by ATutor, a student must be enrolled in the course and member tracking has to be enabled by adding My Tracker to the student tools.</p>

				<p>Yes for us the the individuals that take the course have no actual start or end date requirement. The problem we have is that a person that manages the individuals wants to know who has started the course and when they completed it. I can take the previous suggestion and run with it easy enough.<br />

Thanks for your replies, Gabriel</p>
