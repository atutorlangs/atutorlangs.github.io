<br />
Could somebody please tell me if there is any possibility to upload videos into ATutor via FTP. As I use ATUtor to teach 10 year old children, I have created several courses where I have uploaded videos but it would be much quicker and easier if I can do it via FTP. If it is possible into which folder should I upload it.<br />
Sorry if my question sounds rather silly but I am bit lost with this.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your time<br />

			<div class="body">
				<p>ATutor keeps the cource content in a separate folder which it seems to organize all by it self. So I would not recommend trying to FTP directly into that.<br />
<br />
If you don't need to be certain that other people (non students) can view your videoes you could simply create a new folder on your web server and put your videos there. <br />
<br />
For example you could call it "video". To insert a movie into your cource use something like this:<br />
<br />
[media]www.welcome5thyear.com.ar/video/movie3.swf[/media]<br />
<br />
The only downside is that other people will be able to download your movie if they know the url. The content uploaded via ATutor itself is protected from this.</p>

So what would [media]www.welcome5thyear.com.ar/video/movie3.swf[/media] produce?  Just a link in a content page?  Or does it embed the .swf into the page?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

				<p>It would embed the swf file into the content page. <br />
<br />
Try to use the [media]url[/media] tag with a youtube movie to see how it works.</p>
