				<p>Hello..<br />
<br />
I'm new to LMS and SCORM, but have learned a lot in the last week.  <br />
<br />
I develop training videos to help our employees, customers and distributors learn how to use our products.  The links provided for all training material is public (no login required).  I have tags in the html and php pages that let me track when a link was clicked, but now I'd like to track more information.  Things like, which videos were watched, which TOC item was clicked, if the test was taken, which answers were given, etc. <br />
<br />
With ATutor, can I create a course and give it public access that doesn't require a user to login?  I want it to be a link to a .swf just like any other link.  The .swf produced is SCORM 1.2/1.4/2004 compliant.<br />
<br />
TIA!</p>
