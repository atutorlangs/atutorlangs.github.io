				<p>When attempting to do page tracking, 5 pages show up for a user (for example).  Clicking on all 5 pages only yield the same set of page visits ... which appear to have all dates the students were online (I think).  Any ideas?<br />

I can't quite make out what the problem is based on your description. Describe the steps so I can reproduce the problem.</p>

				<p>I am actually the source of Larry's question.  I am viewing the member statistics for my course as the course instructor.  Each student has a different number of pages showing for their navigation path (5 pages, 11 pages) but each page viewed has the same information...Page 1 for Student A is the same as Page 2 for Student A, etc.  Also, it seems that some of the stats are missing....I had a student take their Chemistry test today, and the member stats do not show him as logging in to any pages today?  I hope this fills in some of the details.</p>

				<p>Looking at our 1.4.2 installation (the demo site) I can not see any problems with member tracking stats.  Each member's  stats  are unique, and the tracker appears to be collecting hits as it should.<br />
<br />
Can you reproduce the problem in another course, or on another system? It may be something specific to your system. Any addition detail about your system might help us track down the problem. <br />
<br />
I am guessing you are running ATutor in a PostNuke system, in which case I might guess that user session information is not being properly communicated between PostNuke and ATutor (ala pnATutor)</p>

I logged into your demo site as an instructor ... went to Show Member Statistics (under course tracker).  Six pages show up for "guest" user.  Page 1 has a list of entries starting on Oct 21. Page 2 has entries starting on Oct11,  included those on page 1.  Excluding the first entry on page 1, pages 3, 4, 5 and 6 are identical to page 1.<br />
<br />
I tried it using both Safari and Firefox on the mac<br />

				<p>Figured it out.<br />
<br />
replace the following files:<br />
 include/lib/tracker.inc.php <br />
 include/lib/tracker2.inc.php<br />
<br />
with a fresh copy from the repository<br />
http://atutorsvn.rcat.utoronto.ca/repos/atutor/trunk/docs/include/lib/tracker.inc.php<br />
http://atutorsvn.rcat.utoronto.ca/repos/atutor/trunk/docs/include/lib/tracker2.inc.php<br />
<br />
There's still room for improvement, but stats should now be displayed properly.</p>
