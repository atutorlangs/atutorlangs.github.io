				<p>I have having trouble with enrollment.  I added a student and typed his email incorrectly.  I couldn't find a way to edit it, so I deleted him and then tried to add him again.  The system won't let me as the first and last name are already in use (even though I deleted his name and restarted the browser and logged off, logged in several times).  His name does not show up in the enrolled list.  I even tried using a slightly different first name - and that didn't work because the email address was already in use.  Any advice.  Thanks. <br />

An administrator has to delete users, under the adminitrator's Users tab. Deleting them from a course does not delete them from the system.</p>
