			<div class="body">
				<p>I'm looking at using ATutor as my corporate LMS product and am in the evaluation phase.  One thing I need it to do is be able to present material generated with Tegrity (http://www.tegrity.com/).  I've tried generating IMS packages to upload, but what Tegrity generates fails by displaying no content.  Using Reload Editor to make a custom IMS package with one organization pointing at course/Sun.htm makes ATutor  at least find the organization, but when viewing the item, ATutor says "There is no content on this page."<br />
<br />
Has anyone had any luck importing Tegrity courses in to ATutor?  Can you share how you accomplished it please?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

				<p>I'm not familar with Tegrity. If you want to attach a small package generated by it, we'll take a look.<br />
<br />
As for Reload, we've never had a problem importing packages from it. Perhaps try again.</p>

				<p>Thank you very much for your kind offer to look in to this.  I don't have anything terribly small from Tegrity, and I don't have a problem with reload normally, just in dealing with Tegrity's output.<br />
<br />
I've put the smallest Tegrity output I have up on the web at http://cleannorth.org/~odin/Vista.zip<br />
<br />
It's 26MB, which shouldn't be too bad, but I didn't want to upload something that big to the forum.<br />
<br />
course/Sun.htm is the page that should launch the Tegrity player.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</p>
