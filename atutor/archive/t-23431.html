				<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I upload atutor from a localhost to host server. I edited the config.php file and install the database. But I cannot login (with correct credentials) or register new user. I read somewhere that it could be write-protected file problem. Or session unable to start. I don't know which is the trouble or how to go about solving it. <br />
<br />
Please assist. My sql table prefix is "at_" and not the popular "AT_". I don't know how that happens or if it is the cause of problem. Please assist.</p>

				<p>It's difficult to say where the problem is. It sounds like you did not do a typical install.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest starting over, upload the ATutor distribution file to the server and unzip it there, then follow the installation instructions.<br />
<br />
http://atutor.ca/atutor/docs/installation.php<br />
<br />
The table prefix would not make a difference.<br />

If you are asking for help, provide lots of detail so problems can be reproduced.<br />
<br />
Things to describe: <br />
  Operating system ATutor is installed on -<br />
  ATutor version -<br />
  Patch #s applied -<br />
  ATutor theme name -<br />
  PHP version -<br />
  MySQL version -<br />
  Webserver & version -<br />
  Copies of error messages -<br />

			<div class="body">
				<p>I read the installation instruction.<br />
<br />
But what I did is to download the atutor package, run it on a localhost and finish my design. Then I tried to upload it to the remote host.<br />
<br />
Is like the instruction is taking about uploading the package to the host server (at first), unzip it there and finish the design online.<br />
<br />
I did all these on localhost (my computer) and only just upload to remote server. Can't this work? And secondly, apart from editing the config.php file, which other file do I need to point to the remote server?</p>

				<p>If you uploaded file-by-file your chances of experiencing problem greatly increases. Some times it works, but more often not.<br />
<br />
You should zip everything together on localhost, upload the zip file, then unpack it on the server.<br />
<br />
Just the config file needs to be edited after a move.</p>
