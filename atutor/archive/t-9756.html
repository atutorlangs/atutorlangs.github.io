				<p>I found the reason. My MySQL server version was it. I can only hardly understand why the installation proceeded. Even the pre-installation check was OK with the old version of the MySQL server. Strange!</p>

				<p>Most everything will work with older version of MySQL, but not all. If you are setting up a production system, you'd be wise to use the appropriate prequisite verion of MySQL, but for testing etc. you can get away with an older version.</p>

Congratulations on your installation of ATutor 1.5.3.3!<br />
<br />
You may now login using your personal and administrator accounts you created in Step 3.<br />
<br />
For security reasons once you have confirmed that ATutor has installed correctly, you should delete the install/ directory, and reset the permissions on the config.inc.php file to read only.<br />
<br />
See the Support Forums on atutor.ca for additional help & support.<br />
<br />
I subsequently deleted teh install folder. Would appreciate any feedback on this.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>
