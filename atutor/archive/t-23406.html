			<div class="body">
				<p>I have courses that require payment  before enrollment. I have PayPal set up correctlu. I need thye pay now page to pop up before they are allowed access to the class. As an instructor, I am in MANAGE,Payments, and tried DISABLING "Auto approve enrollment when fee has been paid" and they are sill being allowed to enroll and access all content of the class. The student does have a pay now button, but that does me no good since he has already taken the class and has no incentive to pay. I need to ensure that payment is receive [b] PRIOR[/b] to the student having access to the class. <br />
What steps am I missing. Please help. This is so frustrating and I am running out of time!!<br />
Thanks Sandy</p>

				<p>If I understand you correctly, my guess is you need to set your courses to Private, in the Course Properties. The Payment module will then enroll students only after a payment is received. If "Auto Approve" is disabled, then the instructor must manually add students using the Enrollment Manager after a payment is received.<br />
<br />
As for a Pay Now button, typically a separate page is created on a main Web site, to which ATutor has been added, and student follows a link from there to the make payment page in ATutor.</p>

				<p>The redirect is setup in the PayPal account settings associated with the Pay Now button.<br />
<br />
I can't confirm the exact location at the moment, the PayPal sandbox appears to be broken, but I believe its in the same place you setup the response_ipn.php URL.</p>
