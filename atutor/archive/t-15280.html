				<p>We had a request to have a personalized domain setup so that it appears our courses are provided by the company that is accessing the courses rather than our domain.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to have more than one domain pointing to and running the Atutor courses at the same time?<br />
<br />
Thanks, Gabriel<br />

				<p>that should be possible, but you will need to speak to your ISP / DNS provider for this. what you need to do is to point the customers DNS settings to your domain, and your service will be available under both domains. <br />
<br />
do note that the customer will not be able to use their domain for anything else if you do this! also note that Google *can* penalty this behaviour (more domains pointing to the same content), but it won't happen in this scale. <br />
<br />
much easier: let the customer live with the page being on your domain :)</p>
