				<p>I searched the site and didn't find an answer, so here goes...<br />
<br />
In my atutor system, I have 100 people who have signed up. Of those, 10 people have enrolled in a given course. 90 people are not enrolled in any courses.<br />
<br />
How can I email all the non-enrolled persons? <br />
I don't see any way to either email everyone or export the non-enrolled students contact info to use elsewhere.<br />
<br />
How do I email the other 90 people?</p>

				<p>OK, so here is what I ended up doing:<br />
<br />
1. Entered mySQL admin<br />
2. Browsed all students in my system<br />
3. Saved the resulting matrix (name, email,...) in XLS<br />
<br />
I guess I could also use mySQL to enroll everyone in a "welcome" course so that I could email as I want.<br />
<br />
Perhaps there is a way to either auto-enroll people or add the menu functionality to the Admin user to achieve this mass email goal.</p>
