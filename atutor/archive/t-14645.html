				<p>I guess you have enabled Master Student List previously. By default, it's off and you shouldn't see ID and PIN fields during registration.<br />
<br />
Check that Admin -> System Preferences -> Authenticate Against A Master Student List is disabled.<br />
If it is, and you're still getting that message, then please do fill in the "Things to describe:" list.</p>

				<p>ATutor is OpenSource, so surely there must be one. :D<br />
<br />
Though it's not configurable and you'll need to make changes to the PHP code.<br />
You'll have to edit four files: themes/default/registration.tmpl.php and themes/default/users/profile.tmpl.php to change appearance (make the red asterisk appear at those fields), and files registration.php and users/profile.php to add conditions checking that the fields are non-empty.<br />
<br />
If that sounds like too much of a work, just see those files -- you'll be mostly copying existing code fragments with some trivial changes.<br />
<br />
P.S. There's no need in "If you are asking for help,..." in each post.</p>
