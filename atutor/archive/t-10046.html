				<p>When I restore from a backup that was created on another instance, no error is thrown, but non of the content appears to be restored. Both instances are on the same version of Atutor and are on the same server. The instances have separate web directories, databases, and separate content directories.<br />
<br />
I am creating a backup on the live site, downloading it, uploading it in a development instance, and restoring from this backup. During the restore, I am checking the Select All and Overwrite exist options.<br />
<br />
  operating system - Mac OS X 10.4<br />
  version of ATutor - -1.5.3.3pl1<br />
  versions of php - PHP 4.3.11<br />
  version of mysq l - 5.0.21<br />
  webserver & version - Apache/1.3.33<br />
  copies of error messages - none<br />
  changes to default settings - <br />
  web browser being used - FireFox<br />
  and anything else relevant - exporting backup from live instance and importing it to development instance<br />
<br />
Any idea why the content is not available after the restore?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

				<p>This is the first we've heard of this happening. <br />
<br />
By content do you mean files in the file manager? If so they need to be linked to pages in order to be backed up.</p>
