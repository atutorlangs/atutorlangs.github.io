				<p>Are there any known problems in version 2.0.2 concerning glossary terms of two words or more that start with a 'd'? I have the term 'distributed file system' defined.  It shows up as a glossary term fine in the text but in the side-menu it says 'There are no glossary terms being used in this content page.'<br />
<br />
I tested out various combinations and the problem seems to be associated with the fact that it is a term of two or more words that begins with a 'd'. For example, the terms 'device' and 'd' work fine. However, the terms 'device test', 'd ', and 'd test' display the no glossary terms message.<br />
<br />
I've attached a snip of the page showing the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
