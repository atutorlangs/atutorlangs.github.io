				<p>By the way, as my content folder volume is about 3T, I didn't let installation copy the content folder and after installation completed I changed content dir in config.inc.php. So can it caused this problem? If is so, would let me know how can upgrade without going to step 5 of upgrade process (means not copying content file) because in this way upgrade will took so long.<br />

I don't see a problem in the strategy you are using to copy over the content directory.</p>

				<p>Hi Greg,<br />
Thanks for your reply. I reinstalled the language pack with no success. I think during regular upgrade ATutor lms convert all courses in content directory but as I said before, I didn't let upgrade process go to step of copy content directory, so that could cause this problem. Would you please let me know how can I solve this issue as I already said my content directory is about 3T and I am sure regular upgrade takes too long and I can't go through this upgrade as we are in the middle of term.<br />
I send a screen shot of my site for your information.<br />

				<p>Stopping the upgrade part way through could cause problems.<br />

I see the Thai characters do not appear correctly. This could mean your database connection was not set to UTF-8. <br />
<br />
Typically  3TB of content directory is excessive, suggesting it contains video. Though possible, loading video into course content, leads to these types of problems during upgrade. Video should be loaded into a video service provider (e.g. YouTube) then linked into courses.<br />
<br />
If you are unable to revert to the backup you created before you upgraded, you may need to go through and manually retype the the content that appears in the wrong character set (after you have ensured your database is set to UTF-8)</p>
