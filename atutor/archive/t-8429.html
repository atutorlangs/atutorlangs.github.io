				<p>I'll like to stop getting email notifications from a particular course forum. Not sure why i'm getting the notifications in the first place since I'm not listed as a member of the course. Does anyone have experience with this? Thx</p>

				<p>Normally you'd just click on the unsubscribe link, though normally super admins do not get subscribed to forums. <br />

Can you give us any more detail, so we can try to reproduce this.</p>

				<p>That was exactly what I thot. I've tried everything to reproduce this to no avail (like creating a test course, and trying to enroll the admin). It got me wondering how did the super admin subscribe to the thread in the first case? I just inherited this system so not sure what other detail will help. <br />
<br />
U said super admins do not "normally get subscribed to forums". Do you know of any possible scenarios of how this could have been done? No user in the course has the admin email.</p>

				<p>I not aware of a way to subscribe super admins. It shouldn't be possible, though the soure code could be alter fairly easily to allow it.<br />
<br />
You could try tracing your way through the forum threads admin is subscribed to, and see what you can discover in the database.</p>
