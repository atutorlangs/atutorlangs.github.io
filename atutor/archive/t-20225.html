				<p>I changed the hosting server. Before doing that I downloaded the files on my computer. I saw some index.html files amonst the files. So after deleting all index.html files I uploaded the content directory with a new packet of atutor 1.6.3 version. And I uploaded sql files to the new mysql server. Then I installed the system again. Everthing went normal. I entered to the site with the user name. Even I had no problem joining my website. When I tried to download a pdf file form a course in my website, downloading went ok but when I wanted to see the file context with acrobat pdf reader it gave a bad file error. I have uploaded hundreds of pdf files to support my students. It will take to upload them too much time. What can I do to save all my works?<br />

				<p>This is unlikely to have anything to do with ATutor. More likely an issue with the connection to the Internet, a server configuration issue, or a problem with the transfer. Try a different browser first. Then try copying over the content directory from the old installation again.<br />
<br />
If that makes no difference, I'd suggest you ask your service provider to look into the problem.</p>
