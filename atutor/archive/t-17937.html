				<p>We are getting closer to a stable release of ATutor 1.6.3. We still need help from the community to test the new features, and report bugs. Please take a little time to download and install the latest version, and do some testing.<br />
<br />
http://www.atutor.ca/atutor/download.php<br />
<br />
The two main features to test in this release are:<br />
<br />
1. Networking Tools: The ATutor implementation of the OpenSocial standard, used for building social networks. This is the first ever release of a distributed social networking application, that allows people to install and setup their own social networks.<br />
<br />
2. Detailed View Course Home Page: The previous tool icon view of a ATutor course home page has been enhanced with the addition of the course home detailed view. This view lists the tools being used in a course, along with recent or current data from each tool, such as links to recent posts in the forum, links to upcoming tests, or perhaps link to random terms selected from a course glossary.<br />
<br />
A full list of updates in this version can be found in the Changelog<br />
