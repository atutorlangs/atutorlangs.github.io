				<p>Hi All<br />
<br />
Firstly, I would like to take this opportunity to extend my deepest thanks to the developers of this superb piece of software and especially for making it freely available - brilliant :).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I have just installed it and appart from the need to convert my database into UTF8, everything went like clockwork.  I am just putting the system through its paces and most things seem quite intuitive. There is one bit of functionality though that I would like to test. This involves allowing students to view and access only a specified set of courses.<br />
<br />
I have had a brief look through the forums, wiki and handbook  but haven't discovered the procedure for implementing this.  I shall be quite grateful therefore if someone can point me in the right direction or directly provide the method.<br />
<br />
Cheers :)</p>

				<p>Because browse course is available to students without logging in, there's no way currently to prevent them from seeing other courses.<br />
<br />
You can limit access though. Make the courses private (Manage>Preferences), and have students enroll. Non-enrolled students will not be able to access private courses</p>
