				<p>Host: Network Solutions / shared server <br />
ATutor Version:	1.6.4 (build r9047 - 2009-12-17 11:41:43)<br />
Operating System:	Linux 2.6.22.10-NETSOL #1 SMP Mon Jul 14 16:26:14 EDT 2008 i686<br />
Web Server:	Apache/2.2.8 (Unix) FrontPage/5.0.2.2635<br />
PHP Version:	5.2.6<br />
MySQL Version:	5.0.75 <br />
<br />
I have done three clean installs. The install goes flawlessly; then when I attempt to login, just as I click the login button, the password disappears and I get an Invalid username or password message, which then counts me out after three attempts. It is very clear that the password is being stripped upon clicking the login button. I have never seen this before with any login anywhere on the web.<br />
<br />
This happens with both admin and personal user login attempts using Firefox, Chrome, IE, and Opera. <br />
<br />
I have numerous Wordpress and one Moodle installation which login with no problems. <br />
<br />
Any ideas?</p>

				<p>The password disappearing is normal. It gets encrypted before sending it to the server.<br />
<br />
This problem generally occurs when working with a custom theme or an older one that hasn't had the encryption scripts added to the login template.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's some discussion here that may help.<br />
http://www.atutor.ca/view/7/14863/1.html<br />
<br />
Or, use the search to look for "login encryption"<br />
<br />
Also, if you've installed ATutor by uploading file-by-file, rather than uploading the bundle and unzipping it on the server, that might also contribute to the problem.</p>

				<p>The solution!<br />
<br />
FYI: In case anyone else has this problem in the future; apparently ATutor uses "third party cookies" in the login process. When I changed my settings to allow third party cookies I was able to successfully login. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your help, it was a supposition posed in the thread you pointed to that led me to try this.</p>

				<p>I guess I wrote too soon. After successfully logging in, as soon as I tried to navigate anywhere, I was logged out, and could not log back in again. <br />
<br />
I do not like to give up easily and have tried many fixes to no avail. I am sure that you have a fine application here and I will eventually check back in to look for suggestions, but for now I am going on to something else. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help.</p>
