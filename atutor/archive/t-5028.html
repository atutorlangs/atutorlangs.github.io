				<p>hi there ...seems I could do with some help... i wanted to test atutor on my local w2k-network. as main platform i used the latest 'xampp' version (apache 2.0.54, mysql 4.1.12, phpmyadmin 2.6.1-pl3, .....). i tried that before and it works perfectly well. when i try to install atutor though (as described in the online manual >>http://your_server.com/path_to_atutor/ATutor/, then follow the step-by-step instructions.&lt;&lt;) nope happens. as written in the subject, i'm fairly new to php-ing and stuff. any suggestions as to what went wrong is warmly appreciated.<br />
thanks,<br />

				<p>There's not enough information in your message for us to determine what the problem might be.<br />
<br />
Are you able to install ATutor?<br />
<br />
Is Apache/PHP/Mysql working otherwise?<br />
<br />
the path in the manual is an example. It needs to be replaced with the actual path to ATutor:<br />
<br />
A web based install<br />
http://www.mysite.com/ATutor<br />
<br />
or a local installation<br />
http://localhost/ATutor<br />

describe the steps you took to install xampp, and test to make sure it works, then the steps you took to install ATutor etc.</p>

				<p>hi greg,<br />
<br />
thanks for your quick response. in the meantime i had a small success: instead of getting \'absolutely nothing\' i get a \'little bit\' now, as described further down... :-) <br />
<br />
my xampp (-win version) installation was \'bog standard\' and works fine - apache-server is accessable via my network, mysql didn\'t work first time, but does now (a problem caused by zone-alarm...:-) ) creating new databases, tables and stuff in mysql is no prob either (phpmyadmin...). my standard browser is a mozilla firefox. as written before i use w2k sp4 as operating system and performed a ground-off installation on a re-formatted hd. the test pc in question is an old pentium 600/256mb, which should be more than sufficient for a small web server. <br />
<br />
as for atutor: i got version 1.4.3 downloaded, extracted the atutor folder to hd c: and tried to access it as discribed in the online manual. as i was not sure which was the actual start-up file i used the /atutor/install/index.php (is that right?) which shows up (although in a somewhat queer \'text-mix\' rather than a pure \'graphical mode\'). a click on the install button leads to nope - i get an empty page... i guess this improper visualization might be a prob with the path to resources needed for the actual installation process. i don\'t think it has got something to do with php (it makes no difference if i php4 or php5-i tried that) or with the apache itself, although xampp uses apache 2.0.54 (which is - according to the manual - not recommended) as you tried that yourself successfully.... <br />
<br />
we are getting there i am quite sure (hope... :-) ). <br />
<br />
cheers and thanks a lot,<br />

            <div class="postheader"><h3>Use EasyPHP</h3></div>
				
			<div class="body">
				<p>I'm not familiar with xampp, but it sounds like it is not configuring Apache to run php properly. If you use EasyPHP, it will configure itself properly by default. The only thing you'll need to do is define a password for MySQL, or leave it blank if you wish (though that might present security issues)<br />
<br />
Your 600/256mb PC win2k, php4 or php5, or Apache 1.3 or 2.0 should be fine.<br />
<br />
When you open ATutor to install, it will automatically use install/index.php, so you don't need to select it manually.<br />
<br />
Use ATutor-1.5RC3 instead of 1.4.3.  ATutor 1.5 stable will be released next week if you want to wait, but RC3 is pretty close to stable now. It could be a file was corrupted when you downloaded or unzipped 1.4.3 causing the mix of text and graphic  (if I understand the problem correctly), though there should be no trouble installing it. Still, use 1.5RC3. It installs pretty much the same way 1.4.* installs. Try it with your xampp system before you go trying EasyPHP.<br />
<br />
Assuming the path to the content/ directory is defined correctly during the install, ATutor should figure out the right paths for everything else. No paths have to be defined to get the installer to work.</p>

				<p>thanks a lot greg, well done indeed.<br />
<br />
well, what can i say greg - it's running. i tried the old xampp version several times before without any hassle whatsoever (on linux-based systems though) and had that in mind when installing atutor now. anyway, i binned xampp, used easyphp1-8 & atutor 1.5rc3 as you recommended and it worked from starters. great stuff! <br />
<br />
thanks again for your much appreciated help and cheers,<br />
