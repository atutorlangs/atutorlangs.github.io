				<p>I've been trying to work up my nerve to try to upgrade my ATutor myself, but obviously haven't done so yet. I'm at a point where I should upgrade, but I have a class in session and just found out today that a class I'll be teaching through a college will be starting in a couple of weeks. I have the following questions:<br />
<br />
1. If I upgrade now, will my courses have to be offline for a while?<br />
<br />
2. I'm assuming that when I upgrade, the content will still be there and I won't have to rebuild all of my courses again. Is that correct?<br />
<br />
3. It appears that you now provide a list of third-party resources to do installations. When I started using ATutor, I paid you and then you had a guy do it. Am I correct that now I would need to find someone to do the installation of the upgrade? <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

1. If I upgrade now, will my courses have to be offline for a while?[/green] <br />
<br />
It will be down momentarily. Generally less than 10-15 minutes<br />
<br />
[green]2. I'm assuming that when I upgrade, the content will still be there and I won't have to rebuild all of my courses again. Is that correct?[/green] <br />
<br />
Yes, everything will remain intact.<br />
<br />

<br />
We still do installations and upgrades if you wanted to have us do it. A single ticket is usually sufficient to cover an upgrade. You are welcome to seek out help from any of the providers. <br />
<br />
You could also try the upgrade yourself. If you follow the upgrade instructions, you should not have much trouble, assuming the server ATutor is installed on is relatively up to date. You will create a backup as part of the upgrade, so in the slim event something goes wrong, you can always revert back.<br />

				<p>Thanks, Greg! You're the greatest! The video really helps (for example, I kept wondering where I would enter the unzip instruction on my server). I am in crunch mode trying to get everything organized for the class that starts May 29, but may try the installation myself next week -- unless I'm still too chicken in which case I'll put in a support ticket. LOL! Thanks again, Greg!<br />
