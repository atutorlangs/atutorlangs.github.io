				<p>I am about to reinstall my original Atutor setup which was with version 1.2.2 and using which I corrected the French language version and am about half way through doing a translation of the Howto for Atutor.<br />
As I have some spare time to devote to starting new course materials and completing the French translation, can you tell me how compatible the new version will be as it seems to be a major upgrade?<br />
Will all course materials made with previous versions and exported to a zip file be compatible with the new version? Or would it be better to wait for the new version to come out?<br />

				<p>courses you export from within 1.2, you will be able to import into 1.3 easily. the only change has been to move the import/export section from the control centre to the course's tools page and renamed to "Backup".<br />
<br />
we also added content packaging which lets you (or students, if you let them) download entire content packages for offline viewing or importing into other courses.</p>
