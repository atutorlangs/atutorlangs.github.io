				<p>I suggest you revert back to the backup you created of your 1.5.1 installation, then upgrade again following the upgrade instructions carefully. Do not use the back button in your browser while upgrading.<br />
<br />
Please see the ATutor handbook for information about Student Tools and modules.<br />
<br />
If you need the 1.5.2 chinese language pack, you might volunteer to update it. See the translator documentation for more information.</p>

				<p>Thanks for your suggestion!<br />
Before I follow your suggestion, I do a test that install ATutor 1.5.2 alone, then test my course server.<br />
I found it didn't work well and occurred the same problems. So I would try ATutor 1.5.1 first and test it's all function.</p>
