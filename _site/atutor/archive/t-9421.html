            <div class="postheader"><h3>Installation of A Tutor on winxp Step 2 Database current step</h3></div>
				
			<div class="body">
				<p>operating system - WinXP<br />
  version of ATutor - A Tutor 1.5<br />
  versions of php - bundled in Easyphp1-8<br />
  version of mysq l - bundled in easyphp1-9<br />
  webserver & version - Apache bundled in easyphp 1-8<br />
  copies of error messages - attached <br />
  changes to default settings -<br />
  web browser being used - Firefox 1.5<br />
  and anything else relevant -<br />
<br />
I am installing Atutor on a local winxp to play with it. No connection to the internet. Extracted the tar to www directory inside Easyphp directory<br />
Configured config.inc.php to include some codes I found on the forum: they are below<br />
Launched atutor locally "here is the link: http://localhost/uploads/ATutor/install/install.php and was taken to the installation process. I get stuck on the database step where I am told " Error<br />
<br />
    * Unable to connect to database server.".<br />
Here are the database parameters:<br />
<br />
* Database Hostname: localhost<br />
*Database Port: 3306 	<br />
*<br />
Database Username: (blank)<br />
*<br />
Database Password: (blank)<br />
Database Name: Default: atutor 	<br />
<br />
Table Prefix: Default: AT_<br />
<br />
Had created the database and can access it using the command line, leaving the password blank.  I did this when I was going through the installation procedures on this link: http://www.atutor.ca/atutor/docs/installation_pre_1_3.php#windows and used this command successfully <br />
mysqladmin -u username -p create atutor <br />
<br />
I then proceeded to Use the SQL file in ./include/db/atutor_schema.sql to create the required tables. Either execute the file by copy and pasting it or by using the method below. If the system adminstrator has setup an empty "atutor" database for you, you can populate the database from the shell command line with:<br />
<br />
mysql -u username -p atutor &lt; ./include/db/atutor_schema.sql<br />
<br />
After I had done all of that, I launched  	http://localhost/uploads/ATutor/install/not_installed.php and got this message: ATutor Logo<br />
<br />
ATutor does not appear to be installed. Continue on to the installation. <br />
I then tried to install by clicking on the link provided  and got the unable to connect to database. <br />
<br />
It would be useful to have detailed installations procedures which are explicit the same way other applicagions do, where the user is guided through all the steps, in details so that nothing is left to chance and you don't get unnecessary questions like this one I suppose. <br />
<br />
Here is my config.inc. php file in include. <br />
<br />
Appreciate your help.</p>

<br />
BTW you are apparently reading rather old installation instructions. The current instructions are at:<br />
<br />
http://atutor.ca/atutor/docs/installation.php<br />
http://atutor.ca/atutor/docs/requirements.php<br />
<br />
Most everything is automated now, so you do not need to manually create the db, or edit the config file.</p>

				<p>Greg,<br />
I am using the installations procedures on the website. I just checked the links you provided and they are the one I used. <br />
Anyhow, I installed from fresh and created a database with username and password. And this time it got accepted, or, let's put it this way, I didn't get a connot connect.<br />
<br />
I then gives me a blank webpage with title:<br />
Atutor Installation with a Logo icon in the top right hand corner and nothing else (print screen attached). What am I supposed to do from here then?  Is this normal? Was expecting to be taken to the next sequence which is Accounts and Preferences. How do I access that one, assuming the installation was successful? <br />
<br />
The documentation does not tell me what to do. When I click on Configuration, I get this "Prior to ATutor 1.5.2 all configurable settings are stored in ./include/config.inc.php., a file which I have anyway. I am using Atutor 1.5.3. <br />
<br />
What are those using 1.5.3 supposed to do to configure the settings?<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

				<p>Hi Greg,<br />
Further to my previous email, it looks like I am still having problems with mysql. See the print screen attached where it says that mysql is not compliant with 4.0.2. I have mysql 4.0.18<br />
<br />
Shall I upgrade to the most recent one?</p>

				<p>I would guess the problem is a specific quirk of your system, or perhaps the browser. This is not a problem that has been reported previously, nor have we seen this happen before in our testing.<br />
<br />
If/when the installer runs correctly, you really don't need the installation instructions. Everything is documented in the installer itself. The online installation instructions just provide a little additional detail if needed. There is no more manual configuration <br />
<br />
I would suggest using a different browser, and if that does not work, install ATutor on a different system.<br />
<br />
The link you included above is to the old 1.3 documentation. The current documentation is at the link in the message that follows.</p>

You might try using XAMP instead of EasyPHP, which is up-to-date.</p>

				<p>Just tested with IE 6.0 and get the same non compliant version of mysql 4.0.2<br />
<br />
If you could provide with me with a link of where I can get the latest exe for installation on windows, I would appreciate. Let me know if I would need to modify config.inc "save for the location of the atutor" or if it would be already preconfigured. <br />
<br />
With respect to the doc, I am going by what I find on the website and it took me a bit of googling to find some of the things I used. For example, I discovered afterwards only that I should unzip in apache httpdoc folder. The doc on the website does not say that, it says that one extract where he wants. Also, I had to create the uploads directory so that I can mention it in the config.inc, otherwise, I was not getting the installation page to display. <br />
<br />
You keep telling me that I am using the old documentation. But this is the documentation which I find on the links you gave me which are also accessible from the main atutor.ca website under the documentation link.</p>

				<p>XAMP is available through our downloads page<br />
http://atutor.ca/atutor/download.php<br />
<br />
Do not edit the config.inc.php file manually. Settings in this file are all generated automatically.<br />
<br />
The doc on the web site says unzip into a web enabled directory. htdocs is one place. But there could be many others, or it could be located in different folder if a different web server is being used. Keep in mind that ATutor is a server system, and a certain amount of experience working in a server based environment is expected. We don't have the resources to document all the possibilities, or provide basic server management help. Documentation for apache/mysql/php can be found on their respective Web sites.<br />
<br />
I am saying the link you pointed me to in your earlier message points to old documentation. Ignore those links, unless you are working with ATutor 1.3 or 1.4.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why you are creating an uploads directory. Do you mean content directory. This is documented in the current install instructions, and in the installer itself if it discovers the directory does not exist. It tells you to create it.<br />
<br />
Your inexperience is showing through....</p>

				<p>Greg,<br />
Finally went thtough the whole process effortlessly. Xampp didn't work "it has a serious db connection problem as I read on the faq". So I used easyphp and this time, I sailed just through. Am actually logged in as administrator. Next step will be to install modules.<br />

Thanks for everything.</p>
