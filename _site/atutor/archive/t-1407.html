				<p>I am not affliated to ATutor so my answers are entirely my own and completely incorrect. <br />
<br />
E Scheduling of "brick and mortar" classrooms<br />
I don't think so because there is no calendar. <br />
<br />
E Student capable of uploading submitted work to instructors<br />
<br />
This will be possible when ACollab comes out in a few days (Jun1 11th 2004). It may be possible now. <br />
<br />
E Support for collaboration on student "group" projects<br />
See above. <br />
<br />
E Ability to track both Web-based and live instructor-led training<br />
<br />
What do you mean by track?<br />
<br />
E LMS-based e-mail (i.e., no need to exit LMS to communicate)<br />
Yes! <br />
<br />
E Calendars available for scheduling and viewing planned events<br />
No. "Demand will decide" there was someone offering to make one but they disappeared. <br />
<br />
E Sharable white board available in virtual classroom<br />
No, I don't think so. <br />
<br />
E Import user profiles<br />
I don't think so. But it is the sort of thing that can be done quite quickly and depends on where you are importing from. <br />
<br />
E SCORM content can be run "off line" results synched later with main LMS<br />
<br />
Hmm....This may be posisble using other software that runs SCORM modules but I have not noticed the ability to relink these with ATutor. <br />
<br />
E Load historical training data from other systems.<br />
....see below. <br />
<br />
E Import/export content from other LMSs<br />
<br />
Atutor is very standards orientated supporting SCORM and soon/now IMS. But someone on the web tried exporting content from ATutor and then importing it to Black board and failed. THis was probably black board's fault. <br />
<br />
E Import/export content from content repositories<br />
Yes. >>>TILE<br />
<br />
E Support for multiple domains (ex.: enabling single point login for use by E-different services)<br />
Don't know. <br />
<br />
E Students able to self enroll in courses or Training Officer can enroll them<br />
Students can self enrol. And trainling officer can enrol them. But, as mentioned above, I think that this is not a <br />
E Mobile code issues tested and addressed<br />
E Access Control Lists<br />
What?<br />
E PKI Ethis security mechanism should be supported<br />
DONt know. <br />
E Content Security required<br />
What?<br />
E Accepts SCORM 1.1 and 1.2 content<br />
very possibly accepts SCORM<br />
<br />
E Output content to a intranet or internet web server<br />
As scorm. <br />
<br />
E Authored content exports to HTML<br />
Some does. Some is. <br />
<br />
E Direct export of content to a content repository<br />
Yes. I think so.<br />
<br />
E Authored SCORM content also runs outside the LMS<br />
Using a SCORM viewer yes. I believe so. <br />
<br />
E Administrators can register students<br />
Yes. <br />
<br />
E Instructors can register students<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
E Chat Rooms available<br />
Yes, and instant messaging. <br />
<br />
E LMS will support Threaded Discussions<br />
Hmm.... I don't see this. <br />
<br />
E LMS will support Virtual Conference Rooms<br />
What?<br />
<br />
E The LMS will be 508 compliant<br />
Is this about accessability for those with learning difficulties (or preferences)? ATutor is very keen on this sort of compliance. The A of ATutor is partly to imply compliance to accessability standards. <br />
<br />
E The LMS will support skills and competency tracking<br />
There are quizes. <br />
<br />
E The LMS will support the ability to define skills or competencies<br />
Perhaps. Hmm...<br />
E The LMS will allow the ability to link competencies with courses<br />
Not sure about this. <br />
E The LMS will be capable of providing skill gap analysis<br />
Not sure what this is. <br />
<br />
E The LMS should utilize either LDAP or Microsoft Directory Services to synchronize users of the LMS with users of the OS<br />
No, sadly not. <br />
.<br />
E Track setup requirements for classroom-based training classes (brick and mortar)<br />
Track?<br />
E Each class created automatically creates a discussion group, announcement board<br />
Yes. <br />
<br />
E New curriculum can be added with a wizard<br />
Hmm...Maybe not. <br />
<br />
E Direct transfer of developed content to LMS <br />
Yes. Direct import of courses. <br />
<br />
E Store content developed by 3rd party authoring tools<br />
E Output content to CD ROM<br />
Exported courses could be saved on a CD ROM<br />
E Plug-ins can be directly obtained from LMS when needed to run content<br />
ATutor runs in a browser so if the browser can handle the content then yes. <br />
E Interoperability with content that is not standards-compliant<br />
Ha! How could anyone do that? <br />
E Finding and editing existing content<br />
Yes. <br />
E Developed content can be packaged into a PIF<br />
?How about zip?<br />
<br />
E Finding/listing available classrooms<br />
No. <br />
<br />
E Scheduling classes<br />
no<br />
<br />
E Support for audio<br />
If you browser does.</p>

I learned that "Threaded discussion" is synonymous with "forums" or "newsgroups".   Apparently, it is on-line learning lingo.<br />
<br />
So, ATutor does have the feature  "threaded discussion". <br />

			<div class="body">
				<p>Thank you Peer, <br />
You are probably right. I thought that threaded meant having a nested heirarchy with indents showing which of the posts. <br />
<br />
There seems to be a slight lack of concensus on the Internet. <br />
<br />
E.g. Here is one person that is (mis?) understanding threaded in the way that I did. <br />
http://edc.techleaders.org/emerging99b/DATAarchive/structure.htm<br />
[blue] Threaded means that there is an indented outline of messages so that you can see which messages were posted as responses to previous messages.[/blue] <br />
<br />
And here is one which speaks merely of topics on newsgroups. <br />
http://www.journalism.cf.ac.uk/diponline/meta/new/Feedback/<br />
[blue] Threaded means that users define new 'topics' and each topic and its replies form a 'thread'.[/blue] <br />
<br />
I think that the latter is correct and I am wrong. Threaded means that there are topics. <br />
<br />
If this forum is representative then ATutor's forum is threaded but not nested. <br />
<br />
Thanks Peer, <br />

What is a virtual classroom? I would say that Atutor could be said to have that capability.<br />
- support for skill Gap Management (Planning of competence and so on)<br />
?<br />
- LDAP integration<br />
NOT yet<br />
- mail server outside aTutor<br />
Eh? Surely it would be better to have a mail server inside atutor? All systems can have a mail server outside them. <br />
- HR legacy system integration<br />
?<br />
- Learning Budget Management<br />
I don't think so. <br />
- course satisfaction degree test<br />
Yes, this could be implemented pretty easily. <br />
