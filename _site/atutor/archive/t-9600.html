				<p>Mr. Greg Gay:<br />
<br />
I have some questions about A-Tutor.  I'm hoping you can help me out.  <br />
 <br />
I want to set up A-Tutor on my web site because it is accessible and I also want to set up some kind of accessible, virtual classroom that works with A-Tutor.  In addition to the virtual classroom, I want to run self-paced tutorials on my site.  I've used all of the big guys like WebEx, LearnLinc, CentraNow, iVocalize, and you know the rest of the story.  They aren't accessible and too costly.  Well, at least iVocalize is reasonable, but I would like to control the system myself.  I've been working with distance learning systems since 1998.  <br />
 <br />
I've heard that A-Tutor has some new plug-ins that will give me some, if not all of the features that I would like in a distance learning system.  I've tried to go through the online tutorial, but I had some difficulty trying to figure it out due to my vision.  I was hoping to run a multimedia file demo of the product and I could not find one.  <br />
 <br />
Here is some information to help.  <br />
 <br />
I'm a legally blind/visually impaired person.  I'd like a system that I can manage locally or get help from my local ISP to help me manage a distance learning system.  It needs to be easy to use for all and easy to set up.  I cannot afford to purchase an expensive system and I cannot afford a subscription-based system.  However, after I get the system up and running, I have no problems donating to the cause.<br />
 <br />
I'd like to be able to have asynchronous and synchronous courses on the site.  This includes self-paced tutorials, conduct classes via asynchronous methods, and conduct classes via some sort of virtual classroom.  I believe A-Tutor can give me the framework that I need, but I'm not sure.  <br />
 <br />
For the virtual classroom, here is my ideal solution.  <br />
 <br />
I'd like to have something like WebEx, LearnLinc, etc. that is accessible.  I like it to have a text chat as well as live audio.  In addition, I really like the application sharing feature.  I do realize that this feature is very resource hungry.  Also, I'd like file transferring to one or all at once and an accessible white board.  This is the ideal solution.  If I cannot have this with A-Tutor, It would be nice if I could have text and audio chat along with the ability to push web pages, like iVocalize does.  File transferring to one or all at once is also important.  Recording the sessions is also important.  Do you have any thoughts?  <br />
 <br />
From what I can tell from the site, ACalab is now integrated in A-Tutor.  I'm still not certain of ACalab's capabilities.  The same for AChat, AForm, and ATalker.  Oh!  I'd also like a way to have students take tests and have the system check and grade them automatically and then send back a score to the student.  <br />
 <br />
Are there other, free virtual classrooms that work with A-Tutor that meet or come close to meeting what I would like?  Are there any good multimedia files that I can view on A-Tutor and other add-ons?  Once I see those, then maybe I can go through the demos on the A-Tutor site and have more success.  <br />
 <br />
Thank you for any help.  <br />
 <br />

				<p>Hello TAM<br />
<br />
Firstly, ATutor is a "virtual classroom." It can be used on its own to develop and offer online courses.<br />
<br />
ATutor has most of the features you've mentioned. I can't really get into details here. Features are all described at the link below, and all the addon modules are described on the modules page, at the second link below.<br />
<br />
As for things like an accessible whiteboard, there isn't one. We do have an experimental one we have been developing, though it is not ready for public consumption just yet. See AComm in the menu to the left.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what you are talking about regarding application sharing. ATutor does not provide that.<br />

				<p>Mr. Gay:<br />
<br />
Thank you for the response.  I will take another look at those links.  I did have some problems trying to use the demos.  If there is a way to see a video of it in use or have someone help me with a walk-through that would be great.  <br />
<br />
Application sharing is where I can take control of a students Desktop and they can take control of mine.  This allows me to see if the student can perform the task that I requested.  All other students can see what is going on, but cannot participate unless the instructor gives them the floor.  It is a great tool, but very resource hungry.  I have yet to see an application sharing feature that is accessible.  The next best thing would be to just allow me to observe the students Desktop or they can observe mine.  That may not take up as many resources because you are only viewing the Desktop, not taking remote control of it.  <br />
<br />
Do you have a phone number?  I would like to talk with you or someone who could help me out.  From what you have told me, it sounds like what I want.  Im hoping that maybe you or someone can help me with a partial walk-through of the system to see the features that Im interested in using.  Once I can see how it works, then Ill be able to review on my own at a later date.  <br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.  Im looking forward to hearing from you.  My cell phone is 585 739-3992.  My office phone after 1:00 PM EST. is 585 321-1451.  <br />

				<p>I'm familiar with application sharing. I'm curious where you got the idea that ATutor provides it. Its not something you'll find in a Web based LMS. At least not without a plugin or third party application installed on your PC.  <br />
<br />
I suggest you start with the Instructor Quickstart documentation. It includes step by step instructions on setting up a course in ATutor. (available as a doc file)<br />

There's also some audio based tutorials at:<br />
