				<p>I'm running ATutor 1.3.1 on Red Hat Linux with Apache 1.3.27<br />
and  PHP 4.3.0 and MySQL 3.23.43. <br />
<br />
I logged in as a course instructor and clicked on the 'Delete' link under Properties in a course that I had created. It asked me if I was sure and then if I was really really sure. It hung there for a long time and something happened to the database. When I finally stopped it and tried to log in I got a message that I couldn't connect to the db. <br />
When I went in to phpmyadmin to try and see what was going on I got this error:<br />
Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock'<br />
<br />
Apparently the mysql.sock file had completely disappeared. Once it was replace then everything came up normal again and works fine. However, I just went into phpmyadmin and tried to dump the contents of my database into a file and got this error:<br />
File '/var/lib/mysql/atutor/content.MYD' not found (Errcode: 2)<br />
<br />
Any idea what might be happening? Right now I'm afraid to go back and try to delete the course again (it's still there). <br />

Thanks,<br />

				<p>Try running mysqlcheck on your database to fix that table. You may need root access to your db. Once the table is fixed back it up (using phpmyadmin or mysqldump or mysqlhotcopy) and try deleting it again.<br />

It gives me the message that the table was being used by multiple clients, but no one is using it, for some reason users aren't being logged out correctly. <br />

The course that I was trying to delete consisted of nothing put text on a couple of pages, very small. <br />
The course is actually fairly small, any ideas on where to go from here?</p>

				<p>After speaking with my hosting provider, it appears that what happened is when I clicked the button to delete a course, aTutor deleted the mysql.sock file for all of my databases (not just aTutor) so that I didn't have access to any of them.

Please let me know if you need access to my database, I'm happy to do whatever I need to do to get this worked out. <br />

				<p>the content.MYD is the data for your content table. you will have to delete all the content.* files and recreate your content table. i think it would be a better idea to simply delete that database and start over since mysqlcheck can't seem to fix them (or try myisamcheck).<br />
<br />
atutor could not have deleted that socket. what may have happened was that mysql simply crashed while trying to delelte from the database. or something else might have happened un-related to atutor just when you tried to delete your course. when mysql crashes the sock would disappear as well.<br />
<br />
try checking your other databases as well as they could also be currupted during a mysql crash.<br />
<br />
you might also try upgrading mysql to the latest 3.23.58 version if possible.<br />

				<p>Joel, <br />
Thanks for all of your help. I remember that when I tried to delete the course I contacted my host and they said that they had just restarted the database- I was worried that I was the cause for the restart, but I guess it could have been that I tried to restart at the same time as the restart- and that's what caused my problems. <br />
<br />
I think I'll just start over with my installation. Currently I am able to access the content to one of the courses that I created, but not another one- there is simply nothing there besides  the intro page- any idea how I might be able to get at that content? <br />
<br />
I'll be waiting a day or two to reinstall- let me know if you or someone else on the aTutor team would like to look at my tables or anything. <br />
<br />
Lastly, when I start over- will I just delete everything- including all the aTutor files and then reinstall from scratch? <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

				<p>you should export whatever content you have if it's important to you. you can do that using phpmyadmin.<br />
<br />
you should then delete the database and recreate it when you do a fresh installation. seems like some of your tables are currupt, so they shouldn't be kept.<br />
