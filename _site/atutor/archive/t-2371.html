				<p>This isn't really support.. but I didn't really see 'Discussion' either.. <br />
<br />
I found a PDF from eduforge.org on a comparison of Moodle and ATutor.  There was a serious concern over the design of ATutor where the authentication mechanism is heavily integrated into each component of the system as opposed to Moodle which is more modular.  The comparison used ATutor 1.3.3 and Moodle 1.2 Beta.<br />
<br />
My questions are, have the developers seen the comparison?  are the issues raised valid or are they part of the design goals of ATutor?  That is, it may be ATutor's design to be a self contained unit and not as modular or extendable as Moodle.<br />
<br />
I'm just wondering because I like ATutor now, but my needs for the future may require something more like Moodle.</p>

            <div class="postheader"><h3>Thorough but....</h3></div>
				
			<div class="body">
				<p>We are aware of the review. It is thorough and provides a lot of good information that will be helpful to the developers of the systems evaluated. As the authors state with regard to an earlier review done by the Commonwealth of Learning, evaluations take place within a particular context, and they have to be viewed through a filter that takes into consideration any biases that may be created as a result of the reviewer's needs, purpose, or preconceived opinions etc.. The same is true for this particular review.<br />
<br />
see:<br />
https://eduforge.org/docman/view.php/7/7/Shortlisting%20of%20LMS.pdf<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know why they would have "serious concerns" over the authentication mechanisms, or even what they mean by that. Authentication in ATutor is adaptable so if you want a particular function password protected you turn on authentication. If you want is public or open you turn it off. Perhaps they were referring to the publically accessible content directory, which has since been corrected.<br />
<br />
We are also well into the development of ATutor 1.4, with the 1.4.2 release only days away. Many of the issues raised in the review have been dealt with in releases after 1.3.3. so you should consider the review somewhat dated.<br />
<br />
While we were able to use the review to make improvement to ATutor where they had identified weaknesses, some of the findings are somewhat misleading. For instance they state that internationalization is weak, and identify this as a barrier to developing a system to offer their Mouri based courses. There is no reason why ATutor could not include a Mouri translation. They've also stated that ATutor has poor interoperability. In fact ATutor is the only system that provides interoperability of content. There are other such inaccuracies. Regarding modularity, in the introduction to ATutor they stated that ATutor is modular in design, though further into the review they stated it was not. ATutor is working toward a modular design, though it is has not been around as long as moodle has so it may not appear as modular. We're working on it. The ATutor base application had to be well established before we moved into module development. Only recently have we opened the source code to public developers, after first establishing a strong base on which others can develop. The ACollab groupware addon for instance is the first significant module created for ATutor. Adding new functionality onto ATutor is not a problem, and we fully expect many such addon modules to emerge as ATutor matures.<br />
<br />
My question to you is, what is it about moodle that you would like ATutor to be "more like", keeping in mind the different philosophies of each system?</p>

				<p>What is the future of ATutor platform? ATutor will continue being free and opensource or do you have in mind continue with pro versions of the system? This platform is used in Toronto University?<br />
<br />
I ask this because I was reading some coments in a moodle web site forum where people was wondering about ATutor or Moodle. You can find the comments in http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=11271&parent=54342<br />
<br />
Do you know other reviews like Commonwealth of learning<br />

			<div class="body">
				<p>I can't actual read the message, but I have seen other rumours in the moodle forums that ATutor was to be something other than open source. <br />
<br />
Absolutely not true! <br />
<br />
If you wouldn't mind setting the record straight, we'd be greatful.<br />
<br />
We are committed to leaving ATutor in the public domain, and it will always be available for free. <br />
<br />
This platform is not used at UofT, apart from a couple small installations. UofT has been using WebCT, for several years before ATutor came along, and it would take much effort to move to another LMS. UofT only supports WebCT for the time being. It's a long story, but we're working on it.<br />
<br />
The NZ Open Source VLE Project did a thorough review of Ilias, ATutor and moodle (though a little dated now)<br />
https://eduforge.org/docman/view.php/7/7/Shortlisting%20of%20LMS.pdf<br />
<br />
Read the previous post to this thread for some context.<br />
<br />
It's an indepth technical review that has provided us (and the other LMS developers I'm assuming) with a clear set of goals for improving our software. We're already well underway implementing recommendations made in the review. <br />
<br />
There's a good comparison tool on edutools.org as well.<br />
http://edutools.info/course/<br />
<br />
Also see the ATutor RoadMap<br />
http://atutor.ca/atutor/roadmap.php<br />
<br />
Watch for the ATutor 1.4.2 release next week.</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>I have looked at atutor and moodle, including the review that was posted in this forum. Right now I'm sticking with atutor for ease of installation and how it doesn't force tens of megs of space onto my web server. I've abandoned and uninstalled a moodle process several times because of glitches mid-way. No such problems with atutor. I was attracted to moodle because it offered 'support' community and seems to have more features. However, I keep coming back to atutor because I actually could get it installed and used.<br />
<br />
My only complaint would be the CSS styles - it's way too bloated and seems to have been built over existing styles rather than re-organized. It took me quite long to change the CSS preferences.</p>

A theme builder is also on the todo list, which will allow you to edit styles from within ATutor.<br />
