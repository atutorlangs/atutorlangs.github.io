Please let me know if you use ATutor. I have found no one who has actually used both. All I can find are long lists of feature comparisons. They both do everything I can dream of. It is the ease of use issues that I want to get a feel for without putting in a lot of time testing both packages.<br />

				<p>No offence ahfund but using the ATutor forums to promote moodle is politically incorrect. Sending ATutor users to see your moodle installation ... well you can imagine what might happen if you were to attempt something like this on a commercial site.<br />

A comparison of your experinces, as weathers requests, might be appropriate. I will leave your messages up for the time being to give you a chance to redeem yourself, if you want to setup an ATutor installation to give others a chance to compare.<br />

On a personal note, Greg, you have been extremely helpful answering my previous questions and I apologize if my post offended you. I hereby request that you delete whatever messages you want to. <br />
<br />
I will say that if the Westhers had posted a pubic e-mail address I would have sent my message to him offline from this forum but he did not.<br />
<br />
I would retract the message my self if I knew how. Hopefully, future postings will be more acceptable and over time I can redeem myself.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the warning I have heeded it well.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />

Mark<br />
<br />
PS I am unsure if the Public / Private option applies to an entire message or just to the attachment. I rpobably should have sent it private even if it only affects the attachment. Sorry.</p>

No offence taken, re your Moodle site. In fact I'm happy to hear you prefer ATutor. I was a little confused by your previous message, since it only include reference to moodle, having experienced a number of moodlers attempting to discredit ATutor in the past. I was not sure if you were one of those people yourself. Apparently not.... Excuse my misunderstanding.<br />
	<br />
Regarding your experience with moodle and ATutor, you should post your replies here rather than sending them directly to weathers. I'm sure others would like to hear about your experiences.<br />
<br />
A note on posting email addresses. You should probably not do this, since this forum is public and very likely to be scanned by spam harvesters. If you post your email address you will likely find yourself on many spam lists.</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>I am comparing both products right now, so far i have noticed that Moodle is way to resource intensive.  Granted I am running both products on an old server, but Moodle would raise the cpu usage to about 50% - 70% percent every click.  From reading thru the moodle forum it sounded like it could be something wrong on my server.<br />
<br />
Atutor on the other hand didnt take much cpu usage at all.  <br />
<br />
Personally from looking at the Atutor code base for the last half hour, it seems smaller and eaiser to follow than Moodle.  The thing I dont care for in Atutor that the dates are not stored as  unixtime.<br />
<br />
I have already eleminated the idea of using Moodle, but if i use Atutor will depend on if it will be easier to do what i need from scratch, or if I can modify Atutor to what I need fairly easily.</p>

Re: dates,  why unixtime?<br />
<br />
I would encourage you to make your own changes, and perhaps contribute those changes to the public ATutor source code. See the developer documentation for details.<br />
<br />
You might also have a look at one of the nightly builds (from the downloads page), or checkout the lastest code from SVN (from the Development page). There are some major changes happening with the addition of the ATutor Module Manager.  A gradebook could be created as a module. <br />
<br />
There will be more about modules here in the coming weeks.</p>

				<p>Atutor is content managment and learning system while moodle is learning management system. I think this is a major difference in the name atleast. I have installed moodle and it wasn't that easy to install and from the looks of it I think atutor is easier to install. <br />
<br />
One major benifit of moodle that I find doesn't really come standard with it. There is a hot potatoes plugin for moodle that also keeps score of exercies you host. The exercises give life to any language course that you might want to host on moodle. <br />
<br />
hot potatoes:<br />
http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/halfbaked/<br />
<br />
Hot potatoes is used to create multiple choice, matching, fill in, drag and drop exercies which can be hosted in the moodle LMS and tracked.<br />

				<p>I tried moodle for a while, and now I am testing ATutor. I have been a heavy user of Mambo (now joomla - 10 customized sites so far), and I am definitely looking for some possible integration between LCMS and CMS.<br />
<br />
Although Moodle seems to have a larger database of users, most questions about installing and wysiwyg html editor went unaswered after 20/30 days. <br />
<br />
Moodle does have problems if you use Firefox, although it seems a server glitch or setting (couldn't figure it out). A tinymce solution just made it worse (no insertion of images was possible). Furthermore, after a painstakingly week, most of my courses just vanished into cyberspaceoblivium. <br />
<br />
I am testing ATutor and it does feel faster than moodle as for server response. No campaign whatsoever for either. Just impressions as end-user.<br />

			<div class="body">
				<p>I've followed several threads regarding a gradebook on the wish list and found the Moodle discussion intriguing.  I have Moodle installed on one of our servers but find its display templating system very complex and other aspects of the system somewhat quirky.<br />
<br />
A Tutor looks like it was designed both by people who understand e-learning and have a degree of aesthetic design.<br />
<br />
Of all of the LCMSs I've looked at which use MySQL as their back-end, I've been most impressed with A-Tutor.  It only lacks two pieces we absolutely need:<br />
<br />
Gradebook<br />
<br />
E-Commerce/Registration interface.  I've seen references to the fact that A-Tutor is open source and it wold somehow be an act of sacriledge.  Other open source programs are commerce-able.  For the purists, I'd suggest making a gradebook and e-commerce available as modules for a nominal fee which could help fund the project.<br />
<br />
Software this good should not be hobbled by a lack of key e-learning system components.:)</p>

We are all for an ecommerce app. And a gradebook too.  But things have to be paid for. In most cases someone has to fund for their creation, or build it themselves. the ATutor team generally pays for things that others are unlikely to fund. <br />
<br />
ATutor is evolving. Components are added when there is demand, and money. Keep in mind that "absolutely need" is in the mind to the user. Most users would not need an ecommerce application. Mind you, a gradebook has certainly been requested many times, though no one has offered to pay for, or create one yet.</p>

I have used Moodle before switching to ATutor. Both installations are used in a test site not production. Although my Moodle usually worked, I made the decision to switch just based on the volume of and nature of the problems reported by Moodle users.<br />
ATutor maintains much tighter control of code and Q &A which may account for better reliability.<br />
I suggest you join a Moodle support forum and you will see what I mean. Happy ATutoring.<br />

I am in the process of deciding whether to use Atutor or Moodle. Does any one have experience with both or know where I can find a comparative review of these two packages?<br />

It hadn't sunk in that a funded project might be the way to go until it was mentioned uptopic.  Now my curiosity is piqued.</p>

As a VAR my approach is to leave the gradebook to other vendors as this is a complex undertaking unless you are discussing a linear type teacher gradebook.  It is much more complex at the district level including new NCLB regs in the USA market.  I dont charge for gradebook integration and will be happy to keep anyone posted on which gradebook programs are intregrated to ATutor. THe first is expected in Q2 of 06.<br />
<br />
eCommerce is available from many sources. the easist thing to do is use paypal to get started, while you research your own solutions. Your hosting company should have some offerings.<br />

<br />
There have been many requests for a gradebook, but it looks like everyone is waiting for someone else to step up and pay for the work. As Karl mentions, its not a simple task, to either create one, or integrate an existing one.<br />
<br />
[green]Who would be paid, and how much would the level of work involved in either project cost?<br />
[/green]<br />
<br />
Whoever takes on the development would get paid. It could be the ATutor team or another developer. The level of work and costs can vary greatly, depending on the functionality required. Projects like these usually begin by drafting a functional specification, along with some research on what is already available.<br />

				<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
to add to the conversation, I 've started my evaluation for choosing a LCMS with ATutor and now I 'm evaluating Moodle too, hoping to be something that handles SCORM 1.2 packages better than ATutor. <br />
<br />
However, both handle SCORM packages as external entities and not as integrated to the content as I wished for. <br />
"SCOs remain separated from the course content as complete learning units."<br />
This makes it difficult for students to locate the SCORM package in ATutor and use it, unless as I 'm still a novice user of ATutor I haven't found a way to open a SCORM package in an easier way. <br />
<br />
It's just the requirements I 'm given for the LCMS to be able to use SCORM packages.</p>

				<p>I am not aware of any LMS that integrates SCOs into content. They all play SCO as separate entities, either in a frame or popup window. Most have an addon scorm player for this purpose.<br />
<br />
Instructors can add a link to a SCO within content page, if they want to make it easier to find. Locating the SCORM packages in ATutor is really not that difficult. Just click on the Packages link either on the course home page or in the main nav bar at the top. The SCORM player does need to be turned on via Manage>>Student Tools, And the module does need to be installed by the admin to make it available as a stduent tool.<br />
<br />
ATutor does integrate SCORM content packages (not to be confused with SCOs) into ATutor content. And it exports SCORM content packages, the only open source LMS to do so.</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>Hey Guys,<br />
<br />
I have so far evaluated 2 CMS/LMS Moodle and eFront. Right now ATutor. Here is what I found out.<br />
<br />
Moodle: <br />
1- Very bloated with so much features and heavy on database, very heavy, almost 200 tables without any add-on.<br />
2- Installed on IIS/PHP/MySQL, installed fine, but unable to load SCORM pacakges (the same package works fine in local WAMP enviroment). Tired tested SCORM couldn't run either.<br />
3- Apache/PHP/MySQL, the installation is lost after 2nd or 3rd Step, no response whatsoever.<br />
<br />
eFront:<br />
1- Very nice interface, use of AJAX, awesome, BUT<br />
2- Does not install on Apache/PHP/MySQL, not easy to configure, force reads global setting of webhost (which cannot be over-written by client-admins) MAJOR set-back.<br />
3- Of course I did a force-install, and it did not work.<br />
<br />
ATutor:<br />
1- One word... AWESOME!!!! so far..<br />
2- Very light and simple, <br />
3- Easy Installation<br />
4- Getting used to the environment, very user-friendly.. <br />
5- I think as the community will grow you will see more options. <br />
<br />
I am evaluating these for a client. And so far I am voting for ATutor, if we decide to go with it. I will definately endorse ATutor.<br />
<br />
Thank you ATutor, Thank you Greg..</p>

				<p>I used ATutor in several projects working with people who are disabled and those who are not disabled.<br />
I used Moodle for testing purposes and discussed extensively with users of Moodle about its features and what they see as important.<br />
I was dissapointed that accessibility is not so high in their priorities which is from my point of view unexcusable fault. LMS people should not support discrimination.<br />
I do not see in Moodle anything special to be so popular to be honest.  All that popularity looks like self-indulgent overlooking of very important features that ATutor support.  <br />
IN addition, I can say that Atutor was used successfully by disabled people, those whoa re not disabled including beginners and geeks to. Thus, all my positive marks go to ATutor.<br />
