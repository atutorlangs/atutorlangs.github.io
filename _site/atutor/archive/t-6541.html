				<p>I'm really impressed with the ATutor CMS. It is one of the best and the easiest environments I've ever seen. I'm planning to migrate from my present Quiz Script to ATutor but I'm a little worried. I wanted to know if the following features can be implemented using ATutor?<br />
<br />
1. The test has to be completed in a set time<br />
<br />
2. Negative marking if required, may be implemented - This means that for every wrong answer, a set number of marks are deducted from the total score.<br />
<br />
3. Give a customised marking scheme to the test taker - This means that the test taker will be allowed to decide the negative marking and positive marking for each wrong answer and correct answer respectively.<br />
<br />
4. While displaying the results, a more detailed result should be displayed. For instance,<br />
<br />
Your Score is 7/20 or 35% of questions answered correctly.<br />
<br />
Test Score is 3.5 with a negative marking of 1/3 marks and positive marking of 1 mark.<br />
<br />
5. Allow guests to add questions to the database in the simplest way possible. This is because, I'm aiming at providing free tests to everyone and i'm planning to use the Open Database Concept.<br />
<br />
6. Import questions and choices from a text file.<br />
<br />
I need more clarifications but the above ones are really really important. I'd be grateful, if someone could clarify if the above things can be implemented using the ATutor Module. Your answer will be really vital for me. Depending on your answer, I will have to decide if I should migrate to ATutor or stick to the present Standalone quiz Module which i'm having.<br />
<br />
Please Help.</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p>1. The test has to be completed in a set time<br />
<br />
[green] Not currently available, but high on our todo list[/green]<br />
<br />
2. Negative marking if required, may be implemented - This means that for every wrong answer, a set number of marks are deducted from the total score.<br />
<br />
[green]This would be a fairly specialized feature that we probably would not add ourselves. It could perhaps be included as part of an addon test module.  [/green]<br />
<br />
3. Give a customised marking scheme to the test taker - This means that the test taker will be allowed to decide the negative marking and positive marking for each wrong answer and correct answer respectively.<br />
<br />
[green]Again, specialized, and something we probably would not add to the core test module, but perhaps something that could be included with a custom test module. [/green]<br />
<br />
4. While displaying the results, a more detailed result should be displayed. For instance,<br />
<br />
Your Score is 7/20 or 35% of questions answered correctly.<br />
<br />
Test Score is 3.5 with a negative marking of 1/3 marks and positive marking of 1 mark.<br />
<br />
[green]More detail could be included with test results, though the negative positive features would likely need to be part of a custom addon module. [/green]<br />
<br />
5. Allow guests to add questions to the database in the simplest way possible. This is because, I'm aiming at providing free tests to everyone and i'm planning to use the Open Database Concept.<br />
<br />
[green]Unlikely to become a part of the core test module. Allowing guests to add question would be a specialized feature. [/green]<br />
<br />
6. Import questions and choices from a text file. <br />
<br />
[green]This is something we want to add. We have plans to develop test/question import export tools, though it might be a little while before we get to it. [/green]<br />
<br />
Just about anything is possible, though we do have to limit features to those most likely to be used. We do not want the test module to become so complex that it ends up being too difficult to use, as is the case in many other systems that implement every test feature that comes along.<br />
<br />
Development also depends on funding. In most cases we fund the features that others are unlikely to fund. If there are specialized features you'd like, there would need to be some way to pay for its creation.<br />
<br />
That said, much functionality can be added as an addon module, which in many cases can be created by a person with minimal php programming skills by using the current modules as a model for creating their own, and reading through the module developer documentation. I'd suspect your test module could be added as a module without too much trouble.</p>

I might not be able to donate because I\'m still a non earning part of my family so I\'ll try to contribute by trying my hand at the features part. I desperately need those features so i\'ll try my level best to learn php and then implement them. Once its over, I\'ll put it here...</p>

				<p>If you want to try your hand at creating a module out of your test utility, I'd suggest you do so using ATutor 1.5.2. The stable release of 1.5.2 will be available in about 1 week, though you can use the current 1.5.2 release candidate to get started.<br />
<br />
It's is much easier to create modules for 1.5.2 than earlier versions of ATutor.</p>

If possible, can you please help me out in one last thing. My previous test module contains around 400 Multiple Choice questions each having Four Choices. That script uses SQL. Is there anyway i could get all those questions into ATutor? I'm completely new to PHP and SQL. So, you need not have to give me a complete solution but please atleast give me a hint as to where to start from. Once the questions are transferred, I can start working on adding some custom features.<br />

				<p>A module installer can run an SQL file to create a table for your test questions. I'd suggest you investigate that rather than trying to get your questions into the ATutor test tables. <br />
<br />
It would be possible to import the questions into the ATutor tables, though you'd need to know what you're doing, modifying the SQL file to match the structure of the ATutor test/question tables.<br />
<br />
Read through the module developer documentation, and look at the Hello World example module to see how it installs and sets up the database tables.</p>
