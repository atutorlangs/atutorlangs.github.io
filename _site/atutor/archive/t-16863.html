I am able to upload files into File Storage in Courses that i creating as an instructor, but am unable to download. The download window comes up asking for saving destination and so on. The download finishes in less than a second. File Size is 0 KB and cannot be opened. Whatever be the file type the result is the same. In System Preferences very generous file size limits have been set.<br />
Currently the site is under development at http://www.leaninstitute.in/LEArN/. You can check with user admin, password admin and let me know what is wrong please.<br />

				<p>I could be any number of reasons. <br />
<br />
Start investigating by replacing spaces in file names with underscores. Then upload the files and see if you can then download.<br />
<br />
If that's not it, try searching google for "download 0 bytes" and see if you can find any answers.<br />
<br />
Can you upload/download from the file manager as opposed to  file storage?<br />
<br />
This problem is probably not related to ATutor, but rather a server setting, or maybe even a browser issue.</p>

Situation is unchanged. I checked to see the behaviour on my localhost on my laptop computer and found it to be the same.<br />

I am stumped.<br />

I tried doing what Greg suggested and removed spaces from filenames, but the problem remains the same.<br />

				<p>Greg, I have created a file called cont_dir_find.php and placed it in /home/leaninst/public_html/LEArN which is the website's root.<br />
In that file I wrote in <br />
<br />
&lt;?php<br />
<br />
getcwd();<br />
?><br />
<br />
and saved it.<br />
<br />
Then I put www.leaninstitute.in/LEArN/cont_dir_find.php but nothing happens. Anyway I think my content directory is visblein filemanager in /home/leaninst/public_html/LEArN/content, that is what is also entered in config.in.php. When I did not do this initially I got a series of error messages. So that is the first problem I solved after migrating from localhost to server.<br />
<br />
When uploading from filemanager should i simply upload into /home/leaninst/public_html/LEArN/content/ . Anyway even if I upload there, will file sbe visible in filemanager. I will do this and see. I am able to upload and download files to and from my website in general without any problem.<br />

Then I executed <br />

http://www.leaninstitute.in/LEArN/cont_dir_find.php <br />
<br />
in the browser, and get a white screen and Done at the right bottom of screen.<br />
<br />
to login to ATutor I need to type in http://www.leaninstitute.in/LEArN/<br />

into the browser<br />

				<p>It does not matter where the file goes, as long as you can open it in a Web browser.<br />
<br />
I don't know how else to help. If you're getting a blank screen, the file is not correct. This is fairly basic stuff, and we can't really spend time helping with PHP coding. I'll point you to the reference, and you can continue from there yourself.<br />

				<p>I dont know why all this is required. php programming should not be required to populate ATutor.<br />
<br />
My content directory is known. These are contents of file_storage in content directory<br />
<br />
<br />
	/ public_html / LEArN / content / file_storage / (Current Folder) 		<br />
<br />
	Create New Folder		<br />
	Upload file(s)		<br />
	Up one level		<br />
	1		755<br />
	Create New File		<br />
	index.html	0 k	0644<br />
<br />
The other files in content folder are:<br />
<br />
<br />
	/ public_html / LEArN / content / (Current Folder) 		<br />
	Create New Folder		<br />
	Upload file(s)		<br />
	Up one level		<br />
	1		755<br />
	2		755<br />
	3		755<br />
	4		755<br />
	backups		755<br />
	chat		755<br />
	feeds		755<br />
	file_storage		755<br />
	hello_world		755<br />
	import		755<br />
	module		755<br />

	photo_album		755<br />
	profile_pictures		755<br />
	theme		755<br />
	Create New File		<br />
	index.html<br />
<br />
So content folder location is known, which was supposed to be the output of getcwd().<br />
<br />
What next, after knowing where the content directory is. This same directory has been entered into the right place in config.inc.php  which is to be found in <br />
home/leaninst/public_html/LEArN/include<br />
<br />
As I said before,  if we do not have the right content directory defined in config.inc.php you cannot get an error free login screen.<br />
<br />
I request you to get into <br />
<br />
http://www.leaninstitute.in/LEArN/login.php <br />
and <br />
user admin <br />
paswword admin <br />
<br />
and check out once and let me know. With your expertise, you might get to know what is wrong in a minute and be able to advise me.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Everything else is working, why not file download in ATutor. The file is definitely getting up[loaded it seems,</p>

				<p>There's no programming. We are just trying to determine if your host uses symbolic links in paths to your Web site. This is not a problem most people experience. It has to do with the way your host is configured.<br />
<br />
I'm still not seeing any output from the getcwd() file you created. I need to confirm with my own eyes that public_html is not a symbolic link before we continue trying to help. While you're at it, also add the following line to the file, so we can see how your host is configured.<br />

				<p>Hi! Greg <br />
<br />
Here is the result of various entries in config.inc.php<br />
<br />
First:<br />
define('AT_CONTENT_DIR', '/home/leaninst/public_html/LEArN/content/');<br />
<br />
Manage > File Manager<br />

A window comes up allowing me to browse to file to be uploaded. I press Upload and wait..<br />
The page jumps to Course > Home<br />
<br />
Home<br />
The following errors occurred:<br />
<br />
    * Page cannot be found.<br />
<br />
The rest of the Home page is as usual<br />

Second:<br />
define('AT_CONTENT_DIR', '/home/leaninst/public_html/LEArN/tools/content/');<br />
<br />
Manage > File Manager<br />

File Manager<br />
The following errors occurred:<br />

In all the cases content folder permissions were changed to 777<br />

				<p>Permissions on the file storage directory seems to be the problem. Files do not appear to be uploading. If you try uploading a plain text file, then click on edit, you get the following error:<br />
<br />
&lt;b>Warning&lt;/b>:  file_get_contents(/home/leaninst/public_html/LEArN/content/file_storage/1/21) [&lt;a href='function.file-get-contents'>function.file-get-contents&lt;/a>]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in &lt;b>/home/leaninst/public_html/LEArN/file_storage/edit.php&lt;/b> on line &lt;b>182&lt;/b>&lt;br /><br />
<br />
run "ls -al" at the command prompt in the content directory. You should get something that looks like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
drwxr-xr-x  12 nobody  nobody      4096 Dec 16 10:23 file_storage<br />
<br />
Then look inside the directory for another directory with the number corresponding to the course id number. Run "ls -al" again.<br />
<br />
Everything should be owned by the webserver users, in the case above "nobody". <br />
<br />
Directories inside file storage should look like:<br />
<br />
drwxr-xr-x   2 nobody  nobody  4096 Feb 26 19:19 1<br />
<br />
File inside the course id directory should look like this:<br />
<br />
-rw-r--r--  1 nobody nobody   65217 Feb 10 18:12 111<br />
<br />
<br />
If the above are not all true, you should recreate the file storage directory, set its permission to 777, or  if you run chmod -R 777 on the current file storage directory (latter which is less advisable)<br />
<br />
Though you base Web directory is in the open_basedir, you may also need to add the path to the content directory to it. This is set in the system's php.ini file.</p>

				<p>Hi! Greg,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the painstaking diagnosis. I have changed permissions from cpanel on my webserver of /home/leaninst/puublic_html/LEArN/content/file_storage/ to 777, and checked. <br />
<br />
Later I deleted the file_storage directory and created a new directory by the same name and set permissions to 777.<br />
<br />
The result in both cases above is the same:<br />
<br />
From file storage menu file appears to get uploaded but when downloaded shows 0 bytes size.<br />
<br />
From file manager menu the same upload causes a return to course home with the error message "page not found".<br />
<br />
I will need to check with our server administrator about changes to php.ini, which I will do tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile I am in a jam and can't go forward with developing my pilot course content which I was working on to serve as an example for my other instructors to follow suit.<br />
<br />
I have done a little bit of hacking in my life. Learning about php will not be an insurmountable challenge.<br />
<br />
I run a triple boot dell inspiron 1525 with Mandriva Linux 2009, OS X 10.5.6 and a fall back Windows Vista.<br />
<br />
OS X is my favourite OS. My Dell works just like a MacPro with all its systems operational and I am quite proud of almost kicking out windows and am enjoying all the benefits of speed and security that Linux or OS X provide.<br />
<br />
In the same spirit,I vow to find a solution to this problem along with you and my server administrators.<br />
<br />
